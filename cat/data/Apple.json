This means that data that directly identifies you \u2014 such as your name \u2014 is personal data,\r\nand also data that does not directly identify you, but that can reasonably be used to identify you \u2014 such as\r\nthe serial number of your device \u2014 is personal data. Aggregated data is considered non-personal data for\r\nthe purposes of this Privacy Policy.\r\nThis Privacy Policy covers how Apple or an Apple-affiliated company (collectively, \u201cApple\u201d) handles\r\npersonal data whether you interact with us on our websites, through Apple apps (such as Apple Music or\r\nWallet), or in person (including by phone or when visiting our retail stores). Apple may also link to third\r\nparties on our services or make third-party apps available for download in our App Store. Apple\u2019s Privacy\r\nPolicy does not apply to how third parties define personal data or how they use it.
