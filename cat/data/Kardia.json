We will automatically transcribe any voice memos and include them with the EKG recordings.\r\nHow do we collect your Personal Information?\r\nWe collect most of this Personal Information directly from you.

However, in some cases, this Privacy Policy may not apply to all European Economic Activity (\u201cEEA\u201d) users. This Privacy Policy does not apply to EEA users using the Services under the direction of a physician, where the physician and the patient have an agreement between them covering the use of the Services. In such a case, the physician or his/her institution controls the data collected by the Device and App, and the physician's or his/her institution's privacy policy will apply, not this Privacy Policy. If you are an EEA user, your Personal Information is stored within the EEA.\r\n\r\nAliveCor has appointed a Data Protection Officer (Brian Clarke) in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulations. AliveCor and its subsidiary, AliveCor, LTD, and its Data Protection Officer may be contacted in any manner set forth below in Contact Us.\r\n\r\nConsent to Processing of Personal Information.\r\nWe rely on your consent as a lawful basis to process your Personal Information for the following purposes:\r\n\r\nInitial collection of Personal Information through the Services; and\r\n\r\nProviding you with marketing or promotional communications. You may opt-out of such communications at any time by clicking the \u201cunsubscribe\u201d link found within the AliveCor e-mail updates and changing your contact preferences.\r\n\r\nWe also process Personal Information based on our contractual obligations to provide you the Services as described in How do we share your Personal Information?, including:\r\n\r\nTo enable the Service to function as expected.\r\n\r\nTo communicate with you in response to customer services inquiries, to deliver non-promotional, service-related e-mails, or to administer surveys and questionnaires.\r\n\r\nTo tailor your experience based on your general region. For example, we process clinicianreview requests from EEA-based users through an EEA-based clinicican review partner.\r\n\r\nAliveCor may also process Personal Information pursuant to a legal obligation or to protect your vital interests or those of another person.\r\n\r\nWe will process your Personal Information as necessary for our legitimate interests. Our legitimate interests are balanced against your rights and freedoms and we do not process your Personal Information if your rights and freedoms outweigh our legitimate interests. Our legitimate interests are to: facilitate communication between AliveCor and you; detect and correct bugs and to improve our Services; safeguard our IT infrastructure and intellectual property; detect and prevent fraud and other crime; develop our product and services.\r\n\r\nWhat rights do I have?\r\nIndividuals located in the EEA have certain rights with respect to their Personal Information. These rights include:\r\n\r\nAccess and Update. You can review and change your Personal Information by notifying us through the Contact Information below of any changes or errors in any Personal Information we have about you to ensure that it is complete, accurate, and as current as possible. We may not be able to accommodate your request if we believe it would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect.\r\n\r\nRestrictions. You have the right to restrict our processing of your Personal Information under certain circumstances. In particular, you can request we restrict our use of it if you contest its accuracy, if the processing of your Personal Information is determined to be unlawful, or if we no longer need your Personal Information for processing but we have retained it as permitted by law.\r\n\r\nPortability. To the extent the Personal Information you provide AliveCor is processed based on your consent or that we process it through automated means, you have the right to request that we provide you a copy of, or access to, all or part of such Personal Information in structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. You also have the right to request that we transmit this Personal Information to another controller, when technically feasible.\r\n\r\nWithdrawal of Consent. To the extent that our processing of your Personal Information is based on your consent, you may withdraw your consent at any time by closing your account. Withdrawing your consent will not, however, affect the lawfulness of the processing based on your consent before its withdrawal, and will not affect the lawfulness of our continued processing that is based on any other lawful basis for processing your Personal Information.\r\n\r\nRight to be Forgotten. You have the right to request that we delete all of your Personal Information. We cannot delete your Personal Information except by also deleting your user account, and we will only delete your account when we no longer have a lawful basis for processing your Personal Information or after a final determination that your Personal Information was unlawfully processed. We may not accommodate a request to erase information if we believe the deletion would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect. In all other cases, we will retain your Personal Information as set forth in this policy. In addition, we cannot completely delete your Personal Information as some data may rest in previous backups. These will be retained for the periods set forth in our disaster recovery policies.\r\n\r\nComplaints. You have the right to lodge a complaint with the applicable supervisory authority in the country you live in, the country you work in, or the country where you believe your rights under applicable data protection laws have been violated. However, before doing so, we request that you contact us directly in order to give us an opportunity to work directly with you to resolve any concerns about your privacy.\r\n\r\nHow You May Exercise Your Rights. You may exercise any of the above rights by contacting us through any of the methods listed under Contact Us below. If you contact us to exercise any of the foregoing rights, we may ask you for additional information to verify your identity. We reserve the right to limit or deny your request if you have failed to provide sufficient information to verify your identity or to satisfy our legal and business requirements. Please note that if you make unfounded, repetitive, or excessive requests (as determined in our reasonable discretion) to access your Personal Information, you may be charged a fee subject to a maximum set by applicable law.\r\n\r\nAutomated Decision Making.\r\nOur processing of Personal Information may include automated decision making, including profiling, which may produce a legal effect concerning you or similarly significantly affect you. The algorithms used for our automated decision making process classifies and categorizes your health based on data collected by the Devices and Personal Information collected by the Services.\r\n\r\nXI. Changes to our Privacy Policy\r\nWe may update our Privacy Policy periodically to reflect changes in our privacy practices, laws, and best practices. We will post any changes we make to our Privacy Policy on this page with a notice that the Privacy Policy has been updated on our Website's homepage or our App's home screen. If we make material changes to our practices with regards to the Personal Information we collect from you, we will notify you by e-mail to the e-mail address specified in your account and/or through a notice on the Website's home page or the App's home screen. The date this Privacy Policy was last revised is identified at the top of the page. You are responsible for ensuring we have an up-to-date active and deliverable e-mail address for you, and for periodically accessing the App or visiting our Website and reviewing this Privacy Policy to check for any changes.\r\n\r\nXII.
