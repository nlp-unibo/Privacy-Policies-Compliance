        "plainText": "Privacy Policy\n\nEffective: 26 February 2024\n\nWelcome to Snap Inc.\u2019s Privacy Policy. This Policy explains how we collect and use your data and how you can control your information. Looking for a quick summary on our privacy practices? Check out this page or this video. And if you\u2019re looking for specific product privacy information, for example, how we process your Chats and Snaps, have a look at our Privacy by Product page. In addition to these documents, we also show in-app notices that provide you more information about our products and services.\n\nTransparency is one of our core values at Snap. We believe there shouldn\u2019t be any surprises about the data we collect and how we use it \u2014 that\u2019s why we\u2019re upfront with how we process it. For example, we process your information to provide you a more personalised experience, including to show you content and information that is most relevant to your experience, as well as more relevant advertisements. Understanding your interests and preferences help us provide a better product experience.\n\nFurthermore, we believe a personalised experience should not come at the expense of your privacy. Just like in real life, there are some moments you want to share privately with your close friends, and others that you want to share publicly. That\u2019s why from day one our philosophy has been to delete content by default and to give Snapchatters control by providing the tools that allow them to decide what happens with their content, like who to share it with or when to save it.\n\nThis policy covers our Snapchat app as well as our other products, services and features, such as Bitmoji, Spectacles, and our advertising and commerce initiatives. When you read \"Services\" in this policy, we\u2019re talking about all of them. Also, if you see us refer to our \"Terms\", we mean the Terms of Service that you agree to when you sign up for our Services. Finally, if you see the term \"Snapchatter\" we are often using that as shorthand for any user of our services.\n\nLet\u2019s get started with the controls you have over your information:\n\nControl over your information\n\nControl over your information and settings is a core part of Snapchat experience. Here, we give you more details on the types of settings that are available, link out to our data download tool, and provide instructions on how to delete data or your account.\n\nWe want you to be in control of your information, so we provide you with a range of tools, including:\n\nAccess and update your information. You can access and edit most of your basic account information right in our Services. Just navigate to your settings and you will see the options available to you.\n\nDelete your information. If you want to delete your account, learn how here. You can also delete some information within our Services, like content you\u2019ve saved to Memories, content you\u2019ve shared with My AI, Spotlight submissions, and more.\n\nControl who can see your content. We\u2019ve built a number of tools that let you choose who you share your content with. In some cases you may want to share content with your friends, and in other instances you may want to share it with the public. To learn more, go here.\n\nControl who can contact you. Snapchat is intended for close friends and family, that\u2019s why we\u2019ve built controls that help you decide who can contact you. If you receive unwanted communications, you can always block and report that person. Please go here to learn more.\n\nChange your permissions. In most cases, you can change your permissions at any time. For example, if you provided access to your phone contacts to make friending easier, you can change that later on in your settings. Of course, if you do that, certain features and Services, like finding friends in your contact book, won\u2019t work.\n\nOpt out of promotional messages. You have the option to opt out or unsubscribe from promotional emails and messages sent by SMS or other messaging platforms. To do so, just follow the instructions in the message like an unsubscribe link or similar functionality.\n\nDownload your data. You can use our Download My Data tool to get a copy of information that may not be available in Snapchat in a portable format, so you can move it or store it wherever you want.\n\nObject to processing. Depending on where you live and the particular data we are processing, you may have the right to object to our processing of that information. This gets a bit technical, so we\u2019ve explained it in more detail here.\n\nSet advertising preferences. We try to show you ads that we think will be relevant to your interests, but if you\u2019d like to have a less personalized experience, you can change your advertising settings in the Snapchat app. Learn more here.\n\nTracking. If you use an iPhone with iOS 14.5 or above, some specific requirements apply, which we\u2019ve specified here.\n\nInformation We Collect\n\nThis section provides you with details on what information we collect. We\u2019ve organized this in a few categories: information you provide to us, information we generate based on your use of our Services, and information we receive from others. Sometimes, we may also collect additional information, with your permission.\n\nWhen you use our Services, such as Snapchat, we collect information you provide to us, generate information when you use our Services, and in some cases receive data from others. Let\u2019s break these down in more detail.\n\nInformation You Provide\nMany of our Services require you to set up an account. To do this, we ask you to provide us with account details (information about you, like your name, username, email address, birthday, and phone number). When you set up your profile, you\u2019ll also provide us with profile details (like your Bitmoji and profile picture). If you use our commerce products to buy something, like those latest sneakers, we may ask you for payment and related information (like your physical address, so we can ship the product to you, payment information, so we can process the payment, and transaction history).\n\nOf course, you\u2019ll also provide us with the information you send through or save within our Services. We consider some of this information to be private content and communications (like Snaps and Chats with friends, My Story set to Friends, Private Stories, voice and video calls, and content that is saved in My Eyes Only). On the other end of the spectrum, some of the information you send through or save within our Services may be public content that is accessible to everyone (such as Public Story content, including My Story set to Everyone, Shared Stories, and Community Stories, Spotlight or Snap Map submissions, and Public Profile information). Keep in mind that Snapchatters who view your Snaps, Chats, and any other content, can always screenshot that content, save it, or copy it outside the Snapchat app. So please don\u2019t send messages or share content that you wouldn\u2019t want someone to save or share.\n\nLastly, when you contact Support (content and communications shared with Support) or our Safety team, or communicate with us in any other way, including through our research efforts (like responses to surveys, consumer panels, or other research questions) we\u2019ll collect whatever information you provide or that we need to resolve your question.\n\nInformation We Generate When You Use Our Services\nWhen you use our Services, we collect information about which of those Services you\u2019ve used and how you\u2019ve used them. This helps us better understand the way our community uses our Services so that we can make improvements.\n\nThis includes usage information (information about how you interact with our Services \u2014 for example, which Lenses you view and apply, Stories you watch, and how often you communicate with other Snapchatters) and content information (information about content you create or provide, your engagement with the camera and creative tools, your interactions with My AI, and metadata \u2014 for example, information about the content itself like the date and time it was posted and who viewed it). Content information includes information based on the content of the image, video, or audio \u2014 so if you post a Spotlight of a basketball game, we may use that information to show you more content on Spotlight about basketball.\n\nThis also includes device information (such as your hardware or software, operating system, device memory, advertising identifiers, apps installed, browser type, information from device sensors that measure the motion of your device or compasses and microphones, including whether you have headphones connected, and information about your wireless and mobile connections), location information (IP address), information collected by cookies and similar technologies, depending on your settings, (cookies, web beacons (small graphic data that recognize user activity, such as if and how often a user has visited a website), web storage, unique advertising identifiers), and log information (such as details about how you\u2019ve used our Services, access times, pages viewed, IP address, and unique identifiers like cookies).\n\nIf you\u2019ve explicitly granted device-level permissions, device information may also include information about your device phonebook (contacts and related information), images and other information from your device\u2019s camera, photos, and microphone (like the ability to take photos, videos, view stored photos and videos, and access the microphone to record audio while recording video), and location information (precise location through methods like GPS signals).\n\nData We Receive From Others\nThe last category of data we collect is information about you that we may receive from others, such as other users, our affiliates, and third parties. This includes linked third-party service data (information we get when you link your Snapchat account to another service), data from advertisers (information from advertisers, app developers, publishers, and other third parties to help target or measure the performance of ads), contact info from other Snapchatters or third parties (if another Snapchatter uploads their contact list which includes your information, we may combine that with other information we have about you to better understand who you may want to communicate with. Or, if you provide us with your contact information, we may use that to determine if we can communicate with you in other ways, like SMS, email, or other messaging services), and data relating to potential violations of our Terms (we may receive information from third parties, including website publishers, social network providers, law enforcement, and others, about potential violators of our Terms of Service and Community Guidelines).\n\nOther Information, With Your Permission\nAdditionally, there may be instances when you interact with our Services that we will ask your permission to collect additional information. For example, before accessing your device\u2019s camera roll or Contact Book.\n\nHow we use information\n\nThis section explains how we use the information we collect. Among other things, we use the information we collect to provide you with personalized products and Services that we work hard to build and improve. Below, we walk through each purpose for which we use information in detail. If you\u2019d like to see a mapping of the data we collect with the purposes for which we collect it, we have a table here.\n\nKeep Things Up & Running (i.e., operate, deliver, and maintain our Services)\nWe use the information we collect in order to operate, deliver, and maintain our Services. For example, by delivering a Snap you want to send to a friend or, if you share your location on Snap Map, to show you suggestions like places you might like in your neighbourhood, content others have posted to the Map, or your friends if they\u2019re sharing their location with you. We also use some of your information to help keep our products up to date, for example to make sure that our Services work with the latest operating systems and devices.\n\nPersonalize Your Experience & Give Context\nWe offer personalized Services to Snapchatters. One of the ways we do this is by showing you content that is relevant to you, or we think you may enjoy based on the information you share with us. To do so, we use information about you across different areas of the Services in order to add context to your Snapchat experience. For example, we automatically tag content with labels based on the content, your location, or the time of day. So if there's a dog in the photo, it may be searchable in Memories by the term \u201cdog,\u201d show up on the Map at the location where you created the Memory and inform us that you\u2019re into dogs, so we can surface you fun dog videos and dog food ads in other parts of our Services, such as Spotlight.\n\nPersonalization can also help with suggesting friends or recommending a new friend to send a Snap to based on who you Snap with the most. We may show recommended places on the Snap Map, generate stickers, or even generate Snaps and other content using AI to share with friends, infer your interests based on your content or activity, or customize the content we show you, including ads. For example, if you watch barista content on Spotlight, talk to My AI about your favourite espresso machine, or save a lot of coffee-related Snaps in your Memories, we may highlight coffee shops on the Snap Map when you visit a new city or show you content about coffee that you may find interesting or relevant. Or, if you interact with a lot of music venues we may use that to show you ads for upcoming shows in town. Personalization also includes tailoring your experience based on what your friends are doing, including showing you content your friends create, like, or enjoy on Spotlight or Place recommendations that are popular with your friends.\n\nOur goal is to continuously provide you with more relevant and interesting content.\n\nFor example, if you watch a lot of sports content, but skip content with hair and makeup tips, our recommendation algorithms will prioritize sports, but not those makeup tips. You can learn more about how we understand Snapchatter preferences and rank and moderate content here.\n\nWe believe it is critical to also balance the benefits of personalization with our Snapchatters\u2019 expectations of privacy. For example, we may automatically tag the Snaps you save to Memories based on the content within it (e.g., the Snap contained a dog), and then use that tag to personalize your experience, make recommendations, or show you ads (such as showing you Spotlight Snaps containing dogs). We do not use the private content and communications you send to your friends to personalize your experience, make recommendations, or show you ads.\n\nProvide Relevant Ads\nAnother way we provide a personalized Service is through the ads we show. We use your interests and preferences from the information we\u2019ve collected to personalize, target, and measure ads. We think ads are best when they\u2019re relevant. That\u2019s why we try to select the right ads and show them to you at the right time. For example, if you\u2019ve interacted with ads for video games, we will infer that you like video games, and show you similar ads, but those won\u2019t be the only ads you see. Similar to our content strategy, we try to ensure you receive a variety of ads. We also use your information to avoid showing you ads you probably won\u2019t be interested in. For example, if a ticketing site tells us you\u2019ve previously bought tickets for a movie \u2014 we can stop showing you ads for it. You can learn about the different types of advertising and your choices about which ads you receive here.\n\nYou can learn more about how we collect, use, and share your information for advertising purposes here.\n\nA note about information collected by cookies and other technologies: we may use these technologies to collect information when you interact with Services we offer through one of our partners. For example, we may use information collected on an advertiser\u2019s website to show you more relevant ads. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually remove or reject browser cookies through the settings on your browser or device. Keep in mind, though, that removing or rejecting cookies could affect the availability and functionality of our Services. To learn more about how we and our partners use cookies on our Services and your choices, please check out our Cookie Policy.\n\nDevelop & Improve Features, Algorithms & Machine Learning Models\nOur teams are constantly coming up with new ideas for features and ways to improve our Services. In order to do this, we also develop and improve the algorithms and machine learning models (an expression of an algorithm that combs through significant amounts of data to find patterns or make predictions) that make our features and Services work, including through generative AI features (artificial intelligence capable of generating text, images, or other media, using generative models). (Generative AI models learn the patterns and structure of their input training data and then generate new data that has similar characteristics). We use algorithms and machine learning models for personalization, advertising, safety and security, fairness and inclusivity, augmented reality, and to prevent abuse or other Terms of Service violations. For example, our algorithms and machine learning models take into account the conversations Snapchatters are having with My AI to improve the responses from My AI.\n\nYour information can help us decide what kind of improvements we should make, but we are always focused on privacy \u2014 and we don\u2019t want to use more of your personal information than is necessary to develop our features and models.\n\nAnalytics\nIn order to understand what to build or how to improve our Services, we need to understand trends and demand for our features. For example, we monitor metadata and trends about Group Chat use to help decide whether we should change parts of the feature, like the maximum size of a Group. Studying data from Snapchatters can help us see trends in the ways that people use the Services. This helps inspire us to improve Snapchat on a larger scale. We perform analytics in order to identify, monitor, and analyse trends and usage. Based on this information, we will, among other things, create information about our users to help us understand demand.\n\nResearch\nWe conduct research to better understand general consumer interests, trends, and how our Services are used by you and others in our community. This information, along with analytics (as we described above), helps us understand more about our community and about how our Services fit into the lives of those in our community. We also engage in research and development to develop new techniques and technologies (e.g., new machine learning models or hardware, such as Spectacles). The results of our research are sometimes used in features on Snapchat, and we sometimes publish papers about things like overall behaviours and consumer trends (which will only have aggregated data across our user base, and not contain any private information about you specifically).\n\nEnhance the Safety & Security of Our Services\nWe use your information to enhance the safety and security of our Services, verify Snapchatter identity, and prevent fraud or other unauthorized or illegal activity. For example, we provide two-factor authentication to help protect your account and can send you email or text messages if we notice any suspicious activity. We also scan URLs sent on Snapchat to see if that webpage is potentially harmful and can give you a warning about it.\n\nContacting You\nSometimes we\u2019ll get in touch with you to promote new or existing features. This includes sending Snapchatters communications through Snapchat, email, SMS, or other messaging platforms, where permitted. For example, we may use the Snapchat app, email, SMS, or other messaging platforms to share information about our Services and promotional offers that we think may interest you.\n\nOther times, we need to communicate with you to provide information, alerts, or to send messages our users ask us to deliver at their request. This may include sending communications through Snapchat, email, SMS, or other messaging platforms, where permitted, to deliver account status updates, security alerts, and Chat or friending reminders; it may also include fulfilling our user\u2019s request to send invites or Snapchat content to non-Snapchatters.\n\nSupport\nWhen you ask for help, we want to get you support as quickly as possible. In order to provide you, the Snapchatter community, and our business partners with the help needed to resolve issues with our Services, we often need to use the information we have collected to respond.\n\nEnforce Our Terms & Policies\nWe use the data we collect to enforce our Terms and the law. This includes enforcing, investigating, and reporting conduct that violates our Terms, policies, or the law, responding to requests from law enforcement, and complying with legal requirements. For example, when unlawful content is posted on our Services, we may need to enforce our Terms and other policies. In some cases, we may also use or share your information to cooperate with law enforcement requests, escalate safety issues to law enforcement, industry partners, or others, or comply with our legal obligations. Check out our Transparency Report to learn more.\n\nHow we share information\n\nThis section explains who we share information with, what that information may include, and the reasons for sharing that information, including when we need to transfer it outside of the country it was collected from.\n\nRecipients & Reasons for Sharing\nSnapchat. To provide our Services to you and our community, we may share information with your friends on Snapchat or other Snapchatters. For example, the content you post to Stories can be viewed by your Friends if you allow them. See the Control Over Your Information section and your Settings for the controls you have over who sees what and when.\n\nFamily Center Participants. When you have enabled Family Center, we share information about the connected account to provide insight about how the account is used, for example, who your Friends are on Snapchat. We do not share message content. Learn more.\n\nPublic. Most of the features on Snapchat are private and for Friends only, but we also offer public features that allow you to opt in to showcase your best Snaps to the world, such as Spotlight, Snap Map, Community Stories, or your Public Profile. When you do this, those Snaps may also be discoverable outside of Snapchat, for example on the web. Some information, like your username and Bitmoji, are visible to the public.\n\nThird-Party Apps. Sometimes we provide features that allow you to connect with third-party apps. If you decide to connect your Snapchat account with a third-party app, we will share any additional information you direct us to.\n\nService Providers. We share information about your activity with our service providers, who process that information on our behalf.  For example, we rely on such Service Providers to facilitate payments or measure and optimize the performance of ads. We do not share private communications with them. We maintain a list of categories of service providers here.\n\nBusiness and Integrated Partners. We share information about your activity with business and integrated partners in order to provide the Services. For example, you can use OpenTable within Snapchat to reserve a table. This does not include private communications. We maintain a list of these partners here.\n\nAnti-Fraud Partners. We share information about your activity, such as device and usage information, with industry partners working to prevent fraud.\n\nLegal, Safety, and Security Partners. We share information about your activity as necessary for the following legal, safety, and security reasons:\n\nComply with any valid legal processing, governmental request or applicable law, rule or regulation.\n\nInvestigate, remedy or enforce potential Terms of Service and Community Guidelines violations.\n\nProtect the rights, property or safety of us, our users or others.\n\nDetect and resolve any fraud or security concerns.\n\nAffiliates. Snap Inc. consists of different subsidiaries owned by us.  We may share your information within those internal subsidiaries as needed to carry out our Services.\n\nFor the purposes of a Merger or Acquisition. If we were to sell or negotiate to sell our business to a buyer or possible buyer, we may transfer your personal information to a successor or affiliate as part of that transaction.\n\nIntegrated Partners\nOur Services may contain content and integrations offered by our integrated partners. Examples include integrations in Lenses, Camera editing tools, to provide Scan results, and third-party developer integrations. Through these integrations, you may be providing information to the integrated partner as well as to Snap. We are not responsible for how those partners collect or use your information. As always, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of every third-party service that you visit or use, including those third parties you interact with through our Services. You can learn more about our integrations in Snapchat here.\n\nOn iOS, we use Apple\u2019s TrueDepth camera to improve the quality of Lenses. Note, however, that this information is used in real time \u2014 we don\u2019t store this information on our servers or share it with third parties.\n\nInternational Data Transfers\nOur Services connect you with your friends around the world. To make that possible, we may collect your personal information from, transfer it to, and store and process it in the United States or other countries outside where you live. Whenever we share information outside where you live, we ensure safeguards are in place to protect the data as required by law where you live. If you want to learn more about this, see the Region Specific Information section for more details.\n\nHow long we keep your information\n\nIn this section, we provide you with information on how long we keep your information, why we keep your information and also highlight how we may need to keep your information to comply with laws, courts, and other obligations.\n\nAs a general rule, we keep information as long as you tell us to, and otherwise as long as we need it to provide our Services, or as required by law. For example, if you store something in Memories, we will keep it as long as you need it, but when you Chat with a friend, our systems are designed to delete Chats you send within 24 hours after your friend reads it (or automatically after viewing \u2014 depending on your settings). Whether we retain your data depends on the specific feature, your settings, and how you\u2019re using the Services. Here are some more factors we consider when we decide how long to keep your information:\n\nIf we need the information to operate or provide our Services. For example, we store your basic account details \u2014 like your name, phone number, and email address \u2014 to maintain your account.\n\nTo do the things you expect from our Services and as we\u2019ve described within this Privacy Policy. For example, we maintain your list of friends until you ask us to delete them since friends are key to expressing yourself. Conversely, Snaps and Chats sent in Snapchat will be deleted by default from our servers within 24 hours after we detect they\u2019ve been opened by all recipients or have expired, unless you\u2019ve changed your default settings or decide to save something, in which case we will honour your choices.\n\nThe information itself. For example, we store location information for different lengths of time based on how precise it is and which Services you use. If location information is associated with a Snap \u2014 like those saved to Memories or posted to Snap Map or Spotlight \u2014 we'll retain that location as long as we store the Snap. Expert tip: you can see the location data we retain about you by downloading your data.\n\nHow long we need to retain the information to comply with certain legal obligations.\n\nIf we need it for other legitimate purposes, such as to prevent harm, investigate possible violations of our Terms of Service or other policies, investigate reports of abuse, or protect ourselves or others.\n\nHave a look at our Privacy by Product page and support page for details on the specific retention periods for products.\n\nAlthough our systems are designed to delete some of your information automatically, we cannot promise that deletion will take place by a specific time.\n\nIn some cases we need to comply with legal requirements to store your data which stops us from deleting your information. For example, if we receive a notice from a court asking us to keep a copy of your content. Other reasons we may be required to keep a copy of your data are if we get reports of abuse or other Terms or policy violations, or if your account, content created by you, or content created with other Snapchatters is flagged by others or our systems for abuse or other Terms or policy violations. Finally, we may also keep certain information in backup for a limited period of time or as required by law.\n\nFor the latest information about how long we store different types of content, check out our Support Site.\n\nRegion Specific Information\n\nDepending on where you live, you may have additional rights, this section provides more details on region specific information.\n\nWe do our best to keep our policies as simple as possible, but depending on where you live, you have some additional rights or there may be specific information that you should be aware of. Please have a look at the list below to see if any apply to you!\n\nBrazil \ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddf7\n\nCanada \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6\n\nEurope \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddfa\n\nMexico \ud83c\uddf2\ud83c\uddfd\n\nRepublic of Korea \ud83c\uddf0\ud83c\uddf7\n\nTurkey \ud83c\uddf9\ud83c\uddf7\n\nUnited States \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\n\nNote: The U.S. State Privacy Notice applies only if you are a resident of certain U.S. states that have implemented state-level privacy laws.\n\nSome jurisdictions require that we state our legal basis for processing data for particular purposes. You can find that information here.\n\nOur audience\n\nOur Services are directed to individuals 13 years and older.\n\nOur Services are not directed to children under the age of 13, and you must confirm that you are 13 years or older in order to create an account and use our Services. If we have actual knowledge that you are under the age of 13 (or the minimum age at which a person may use the Services in your state, province, or country without parental consent, if greater), we will stop providing Services to you and delete your account and data.\n\nIn addition, we may also limit how we collect, use, and store some of the information of Snapchatters under 18. In some cases, this means we will be unable to provide certain functionality to people under the age of 18.\n\nUpdates to the Privacy Policy\n\nWe may update our Privacy Policy from time to time, and will give you a heads-up if we make any changes we think you should know about.\n\nWe may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. But when we do, we\u2019ll let you know one way or another. Sometimes, we\u2019ll let you know by revising the date at the top of the Privacy Policy that\u2019s available on our website and mobile application. Other times, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our websites\u2019 home pages or providing you with an in-app notification).\n\nContact us\n\nHave any questions about the information here? You can contact us here.\n\nEEA and UK Privacy Notice\n\nEffective: 6 November 2023\n\nThis notice provides additional information for users in the European Economic Area (EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK). Users in the EEA and UK have certain privacy rights as specified under EU and UK law, including the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) and UK Data Protection Act 2018. Our Privacy Principles and the privacy controls we offer to all users are in line with these laws\u2014this notice makes sure we cover the EEA and UK-specific requirements. For example, all users can request a copy of their data, request deletion, and control their privacy settings in the app. For the full picture, check out our Privacy Policy.\n\nData Controller\n\nIf you\u2019re a user in the EEA or UK, you should know that Snap Inc. is the controller of your personal information.\n\nRights of access, deletion, correction and portability\n\nYou can exercise your rights of access, deletion, correction, and portability as described in the Control Over Your Information section of the Privacy Policy.\n\nBases for using your information\n\nYour country only allows us to use your personal information when certain conditions apply. These conditions are called \u201clegal bases\u201d and, at Snap, we typically rely on one of four:\n\nContract. One reason we might use your information is because you\u2019ve entered into an agreement with us. For example, when you buy an On-Demand Geofilter and accept our Custom Creative Tools Terms, we need to use some of your information to collect payment and make sure we show your Geofilter to the right people at the right place and time.\n\nLegitimate interest.  Another reason we might use your information is that we have \u2013 or a third party has \u2013 a legitimate interest in doing so. For instance, we need to use your information to provide and improve our services, including protecting your account, delivering your Snaps, providing customer support, and helping you find friends and content we think you\u2019ll like. As most of our services are free, we also use some information about you to try and show you ads you\u2019ll find interesting. An important point to understand about legitimate interest is that our interests don\u2019t outweigh your right to privacy, so we only rely on legitimate interest when we think the way we are using your data doesn\u2019t significantly impact your privacy or would be expected by you or there is a compelling reason to do so. We explain our legitimate business reasons for using your information in more detail here.\n\nConsent. In some cases we\u2019ll ask for consent to use your information for specific purposes. If we do, we\u2019ll make sure you can revoke your consent in our services or through your device permissions. Even if we\u2019re not relying on consent to use your information, we may ask you for permission to access data like contacts and location.\n\nLegal obligation.  We may be required to use your personal information to comply with the law, such as when we respond to valid legal processing or need to take action to protect our users. Our policy is to notify Snapchatters when we receive legal process seeking their account information, with some exceptions.

Personalisation - Content\n\nPURPOSE DESCRIPTION:\nSnapchat Services are personalised and Snap processes personal information of Snapchatters to provide these personalised Services, including to:\n\nAdd context to Snapchatter experiences, for example by tagging Snapchatter Memories with searchable labels based on Snapchatter location (if setting is turned on) and the content of Snapchatter photo or video (for example, if there's a dog in Snapchatter photo, it may be searchable in Memories by the term \"dog\").\n\nSuggesting friends, recommendations in Snap Map, generating Snaps and other content using AI to share with friends, inferring Snapchatter interests based on Snapchatter content or activity, or customising the content we show Snapchatters, including ads.\n\nCATEGORIES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION:\nPersonal Information provided by Snapchatters\n    - Account details\n    - Profile details\n    - Payment and related information, if making purchases\n    - Public Content\n    - Memories\n    - Content & Communications with My AI\n    - Research Data\n\nPersonal Information generated by Snap\n\n    -

Users would not be able to access content that interests them, new content partners would not be able to find an interested audience and Snap would not be able to keep the platform safe and enjoyable for everyone without this personalisation.\n\nWe can rely on this legal basis because (1) we inform users of this purpose in our Privacy Centre, Privacy Policy and Snapchat Support pages, (2) we use the least intrusive means, and (3) we have appropriately balanced this purpose with Snapchatters\u2019 rights and interests and ensured the processing is within the reasonable expectation of Snapchatters (including our teenage users).\n\n______________________________________\n\nPURPOSE:\nOperate, Deliver & Maintain - Personalisation & Measurement - Ads\n\nPURPOSE DESCRIPTION:\nAnother way we provide a personalised Service is through the ads we show. This includes ad personalisation, targeting and measurement both on and off our Services.\n\nCATEGORIES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION:\nPersonal Information provided by Snapchatters\n    - Account details\n    - Profile details\n    - Payment and related information, if making purchases\n    - Public Content\n    - Memories\n    - Content & Communications with My AI\n\nPersonal Information generated by Snap\n    - Usage Information\n    - Content Information\n    - Device Information\n    - Camera, Photos and Audio (when using the app, if you\u2019ve granted permission)\n    - Location Information (depending on settings)\n    - Information Collected by Cookies and other Technologies (depending on settings)\n    - Log Information\n\nPersonal Information obtained from third parties\n    - Linked Third-Party Service Data\n    - Data from Advertisers\n\nLEGAL BASIS(ES) FOR PROCESSING:\n    - Contract\n    - Legitimate Interest\n    - Legal obligation\n\nEXPLANATION WHERE RELYING ON LEGITIMATE INTEREST:\nSnap, its users and advertisers have a legitimate interest in personalising and measuring the effectiveness of advertising. When Snaps displays ads, Snap uses information to improve the quality of the ads. This allows Snap to provide a better experience more in line with a user\u2019s interests and is necessary to provide more valuable advertising offerings that generate revenue to support and improve Snap\u2019s Services.\n\nWithout ad personalisation, Snap\u2019s advertising would be less compelling to users who saw it and far less valuable to advertisers.\n\nAd measurement is essential to give advertisers a means of better understanding the performance of the advertising they purchase through Snap. Advertising measurement is a critical component of Snap\u2019s business because it enables advertisers to make informed decisions about what kinds of advertisements they should run, when, what kinds of content to include and the audiences they should try to reach. Without ad measurement, Snap\u2019s advertising would be less compelling to those who saw it and far less valuable to advertisers.\n\nWe can rely on this legal basis because (1) we inform users of this purpose in our Privacy Centre, Privacy Policy and support pages, (2) we use the least intrusive means, and (3) we have appropriately balanced this purpose with Snapchatters\u2019 rights and interests and ensured the processing is within the reasonable expectation of Snapchatters (including our teenage users).\n\n______________________________________\n\nPURPOSE:\nDevelopment\n\nPURPOSE DESCRIPTION:\nDevelop and improve our features and Services, including algorithms and machine learning models, including for personalisation, advertising, augmented reality, safety and security, fairness and inclusivity, and to prevent abuse or other Terms of Services violations\n\nCATEGORIES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION:\nPersonal Information provided by Snapchatters\n    - Account details\n    - Profile details\n    - Payment and related information, if making purchases\n    - Private Content & Communications\n    - Public Content\n    - Memories\n    - Content & Communications with My AI\n    - Support Communications\n    - Research Data\n\nPersonal Information generated by Snap\n    - Usage Information\n    - Content Information\n    - Device Information\n    - Camera, Photos and Audio (when using the app, if you\u2019ve granted permission)\n    - Location Information (depending on settings)\n    - Information Collected by Cookies and other Technologies (depending on settings)\n    - Log Information\n\nPersonal Information obtained from third parties\n    - Linked Third-Party Service Data\n    - Data from Advertisers\n    - Data relating to potential violations of our Terms of Service and Community Guidelines (including violations of the law) provided to us by website publishers, social network providers, law enforcement and others\n\nLEGAL BASIS(ES) FOR PROCESSING:\n    - Contract\n    - Legitimate Interest\n    - Legal obligation\n\nEXPLANATION WHERE RELYING ON LEGITIMATE INTEREST:\nSnap, its users, its content partners and advertisers have a legitimate interest in Snap developing and improving its features, including through the use of algorithms and machine learning models for personalisation and advertising.
