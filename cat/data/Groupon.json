If we make any material changes we will notify you, either by email (sent to the email address specified in your account), by means of notice on the Site or by using other methods. You can determine when this version of the Privacy Statement was adopted by referring to the \u201cEffective Date\u201d above.\r\n\r\nYou understand that your continued use of the Site after we send a notice about our changes to the Privacy Statement means that the collection, control, processing, and use of your personal data is subject to the updated Privacy Statement. If you object to any changes, you may modify your account settings or close your account as described below.\r\n\r\n1. Personal Data We Collect\r\nWe will collect the following personal data when you interact with the Site for the reasons listed here and in Sections 4 and 5 below:\r\n\r\nAuthentication and identification information (e.g. your name, email address, and password). This information is necessary to enablue us to fulfil our contractual obligation to provide services to you under our Terms of Use by allowing you to set up and log you into your account, but you do have the option to make purchases without creating a password. If you don\u2019t provide this, we may not be able to provide our full range of account services to you;\r\nBasic personal details (e.g. your date of birth and nationality). We may collect these additional personal details for the purposes of building a profile for you to better understand customer behaviour and enable us to display more relevant offerings to you, as it is in our legitimate interest to promote offerings you are more likely to buy;\r\nContact details (e.g. your postal address, telephone number, and email address). To fulfil our contractual obligations to facilitate transactions we may need some of this information to enable Sellers to deliver products to you, such as your postal address to deliver physical products and your email address to send you vouchers, and won\u2019t be able to carry out these services if you don\u2019t provide it;\r\nPayment details (e.g. your credit card details or payment tokens from third party payment providers like PayPal). We use these to process your order and fulfil our contractual obligations to you, and won\u2019t be able to take payment from you or give refunds if you don\u2019t provide it; and\r\nWith your consent, information about your contacts with Groupon (e.g. call recordings, instant messages on our site, and user generated content) so that we have a record of your communication with us, as it is in our legitimate interest to receive customer feedback, be able to respond to customers and analyze the quality of responses.\r\nSome information we collect is necessary for us to provide our services or meet our legal obligations. We will make this clear when we collect that information from you.\r\n\r\nWe will also automatically collect personal data when you interact with the Site through your computer, mobile device, or other device. This personal data includes the following:\r\n\r\nAnalytics data (e.g. information about app downloads, app and web page histories), which may include data collected from cookies and other types of device identifiers;\r\nProfile inputs (e.g. page and deal views on the site, purchase details, click information and information about the website you clicked to our Site from). This may include data about your location. With respect to geolocation information collected from your mobile device, we will only collect this where you have provided consent; and\r\nDevice details (e.g. MAC address, IP address, bluetooth data and advertising identifiers).\r\nWe collect this data to improve the quality of our services by better understanding our customers and to enable us to tailor our offerings to suit you, as set out in more detail below, as it is in our legitimate interest to promote offerings you are more likely to buy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe may also receive personal data and other online and offline information from third parties with whom we conduct business, such as merchants, co-marketers, distributors, resellers, and other companies or organizations with whom we enter into agreements to support our business and operations, including advertising partners and third party data providers that provide us with supplemental or additional information about our customers (collectively \u201cBusiness Partners\u201d).\r\n\r\nThe personal data we receive from Business Partners includes basic personal details, contact details, device details, profile inputs, as well as:\r\n\r\nDemographic information, (e.g. details about age brackets and educational background);\r\nLocation data (e.g. information about postal or ZIP code); and\r\nPurchase information from third party sites (e.g. information about purchases on other sites).\r\nWe will only receive data from our Business Partners where they are legally permitted to share such data, and we will only process that data for the purposes described below. We use the data provided to better understand your preferences, deals that are relevant to you, and how our merchants are performing. By combining the data we collect directly from you with that received from third parties, we are able to provide you with a better, and more personalized, Groupon experience, as it is in our legitimate interest to promote offerings you are more likely to buy.\r\n\r\nWe will collect the personal data described above at various stages in your relationship with us when you:\r\n\r\nRegister, subscribe, authorise the transfer of, or create an account with us. If you choose not to create a password for your account, we create an account and link your purchase details to your email address, which you can set a password for during each purchase;\r\nOpen or respond to emails or messages from us;\r\nProvide information to enroll or participate in programs provided on behalf of, or together with Sellers and Business Partners, with your consent or as necessary to provide services you have requested;\r\nVisit any page online that displays our ads or content;\r\nPurchase products or services on or through the Site from Sellers;\r\nConnect, log-in, or link to the Site using social networking tools; and\r\nPost comments to the online communities sections of the Site.\r\nWe also create profiles about you based on the personal data you provide to us or that is collected about you, as described above and including personal data that we receive from Business Partners. We do this to market offers to you we think you would be interested in buying as it is in our legitimate interest to promote offerings you are more likely to buy. The contents of that profile include:\r\n\r\nAccount details. For example, we create a permanent URL to your account page which may include your name. We also generate tokens to remember your subscription and purchase histories, and any loyalty numbers you may have obtained;\r\nMarketing segment information. For example, if you purchase products or services related to wellness and beauty, we may infer that you are interested in these types of products, or if you purchase Groupon Travels deals we may infer that you are a frequent traveler;\r\nAudience information. We create audiences based on parameters such as gender, age, and location (e.g. males aged 25-35 in your city), and if your personal data matches those audiences, you\u2019ll be assigned to it. This is to help you receive relevant offers; and\r\nActivity information. Based on your interactions with communications, we\u2019ll generate personal data about how many communications you like to receive, so that we don\u2019t send you more than are useful to you.\r\nMedia displayed\r\n2. Your Choices\r\nYou can manage the types of personal data you provide to us and can limit how we communicate with you. At the same time, we think that the more you tell us about yourself and what you like, the more relevant and valuable your experience with our Site and services will be.\r\n\r\nYou can manage your email, push notification, location information and subscription notification preferences by logging into your account through the Site or by adjusting the settings in our mobile application:\r\n\r\nPush notifications and location information. Your device and the Groupon mobile app provide you with options to control push notifications and how and when we collect your geolocation. You can disallow our use of certain location data through your device or browser settings, for example, by disabling \u201cLocation\u201d services for the Groupon application in Apple\u2019s iOS and Android privacy settings, or by disabling \u201cLocation\u201d services for your device;\r\nSubscriptions. You can also manage your subscriptions by following subscription management instructions contained in any commercial emails that we send you. You may choose to subscribe to some types of messages, and may choose not to subscribe to, or to unsubscribe from, others. You may update your subscription preferences at any time. Even if you decide not to subscribe to, or to unsubscribe, from promotional email messages, we may still need to contact you with important transactional information related to your account and your purchases from Sellers. For example, even if you have unsubscribed from our promotional email messages or push notifications, we will still send you confirmations when you make purchases on the Site;\r\nCookies. You can manage how your browser handles cookies. You may also manage how your mobile device and mobile browser share information on and about your devices with us, as well as how your mobile browser handles cookies;\r\nSocial networking. You may also manage sharing certain personal data with us when you connect with us through social networking platforms or applications. Please refer to Section 8 below and also the privacy policy and settings of the social networking website or application to determine how you may adjust our permissions and manage the interactivity between us and your social networking account or your mobile device.\r\n3.

You may also revoke your consent to the processing of your personal data, to the extent consent was required and provided by you.
