In this case, we may have to cancel our service to you but we will notify you if this is the case at the time.\r\n\r\n4.

We share this feedback with other Deliveroo users and partners, particularly any feedback on the partners\u2019 menu.\r\n\r\nWhen you respond to surveys we may use the comments and/or feedback you leave on our Sites in our marketing or advertising materials. We will only identify you for this purpose by the name and the city you have provided us, unless you have chosen for your name not to appear on our Sites and in our marketing or advertising materials. We also use your survey comments and feedback to:\r\n\r\ngenerate aggregated insights to help us to assess and improve our services; and \r\nshare aggregated insights with our partners to enable them to assess and improve their services.\r\nYour name will not be used when generating or sharing these aggregated insights. \r\n\r\nWe analyse data about your use of the Sites and the services to create profiles relating to you and for you. This means that we make certain assumptions about what you may be interested in and use this, for example, to send you more tailored marketing communications, to present you with partners that we think you will prefer, or to let you know about special offers or products which we think you may be interested in (including Deliveroo for Work). This activity is referred to as profiling and you have certain rights in relation to this type of processing. Please see \u201cYour Rights\u201d section for more details.\r\n\r\nWe also use your information:\r\n\r\nwhere we have your consent, for example where you report to us a food allergy or incident related to a delivery and you allow us to share this with our partners to help them investigate the issue for you, and \r\nto comply with any legal obligation or regulatory requirement to which we are subject.\r\n5. Deliveroo For Work\r\nWe process your information to determine whether you may be interested in hearing about our Deliveroo for Work service and, if your employer signs up for Deliveroo for Work, to make this service available to you.\r\n\r\nWhere we think you are using your Deliveroo account for business purposes and your company may be interested in our Deliveroo for Work service, where appropriate, we will contact you (by email or telephone) to let you know about this service. We do this as it's in our legitimate business interests. You have the right to object to receiving these types of communications, which you can do by responding to our emails to unsubscribe or by contacting us using the contact details in this privacy policy.\r\n\r\nIf your employer signs up for Deliveroo for Work, we will contact you to let you know that the Deliveroo for Work service is available to you. If you would like to take up your employer\u2019s offer to use Deliveroo for Work, we will tag your Deliveroo account as having a Deliveroo for Work allowance. For more information, please contact your employer.\r\n\r\nWhen you use Deliveroo for Work, we will process your information for the purposes set out in section \"Use of Your Information\" above. We will also share information relating to your order (such as the order date and time, the payment amount and the partner with which the order was placed) with your employer.\r\n\r\n6. Cookies\r\nYou can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when websites set or access cookies. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of the Site may become inaccessible or not function properly. For more information about the cookies we use, and how to set or amend your cookie preferences, please see our Cookie Policy.\r\n\r\n7. Marketing\r\nWhere you have given your consent or where we have a legitimate interest for doing so (and are permitted to do so by law) we will use your information to let you know about our other products and services, or Deliveroo initiatives that may be of interest to you and we may contact you to do so by email, post, phone, or push notification or in-app message.\r\n\r\nWe use online advertising to keep you aware of what we\u2019re up to and to help you see and find our products.\r\n\r\nWe use your information to make sure the online ads we manage are relevant to you and so you may see Deliveroo banners and ads when you are on our Sites or other third party websites and apps, such as on social media, or relevant third party ads on our Sites. We manage this through a variety of digital marketing networks and using a range of advertising technologies of third party advertising partners (\u201cAdvertising Partners\u201d). The banners and ads you see are based on information we hold about you, or your previous use of our services (for example, your order history) or on banners or ads on our Sites that you have previously clicked on.  \r\n\r\nYou can control your marketing preferences by:\r\n\r\nvisiting our website, www.deliveroo.it, or mobile application;\r\nclicking on \"Account\" (for our website this is under the drop-down menu); and\r\nscrolling down to \"Contact Preferences\".\r\nWhere you have chosen at a device level to begin or continue receiving push notifications from us, we send you push notifications relating to the services that you have requested from us and information about our services, offers and Deliveroo initiatives. You can choose to stop receiving push notifications from us at any time by changing your preferences on your mobile device.\r\n\r\nWe may still contact you through email where you have opted out of direct marketing with service communications, such as correspondence providing information about your order, service interruption and delivery safety.\r\n\r\nWe use your information to send you communications that are the most relevant to you. You have certain rights in relation to this type of processing. Please see \u201cYour Rights\u201d section for more details.\r\n\r\nIn addition, when you interact with ads on our Sites or a Deliveroo ad on a third-party site or app, we or relevant Advertising Partners collect personal information about your interaction with the relevant ad, which is used to provide us with aggregated statistics and reports (which do not contain your personal information) to help to measure the effectiveness of our advertising or third party advertising on our Sites or our Advertising Partners platforms.  \r\n\r\nWe and/or our Advertising Partners use tracking technologies to serve and measure the ads you see. For more information on our use of cookies and other similar technologies (including advertising technologies) and details on how to manage your consent to cookies please \u201cCookies\u201d section and our Cookie Policy.\r\n\r\n8. Automated Decisions\r\nWe undertake fraud checks on all customers which is necessary for us to: \r\n\r\nperform our contracted services to customers; \r\nensure that our services (and those of all our partners) provided are duly paid for;\r\nensure that customers themselves are protected from fraudulent transactions being made on their payment cards.\r\nGiven the volume of customer orders we handle, we use automated systems, including from a third party fraud detection provider called Ravelin. This system analyses order data to make automated decisions as to whether or not we should accept an order. This is a fairer and more accurate and efficient way of conducting fraud checks since human checks would simply not be possible in the timeframes and given the volumes of customers that we deal with.\r\n\r\nThe checks and decisions that are made look at various components including known industry indicators of fraud which our expert fraud detection provider makes available to us, as well as fraud patterns we have detected on our Sites. When combined, these generate an automated score indicating the likelihood of a fraudulent transaction. Where we believe there may be fraudulent activity we may block you from placing an order and using our Sites. The specific fraud indicators are dynamic so will change depending on what types of fraud are being detected in the industry, country and our Sites at any particular time.\r\n\r\nOur fraud detection is in place to protect our customers, as well as Deliveroo. You have the right to contest any automated decision made about you and to be given more information about why any such decision was made. Please see \u201cYour Rights\u201d section for more details.\r\n\r\n9. Retention Of Your Information\r\nWe will only retain your information for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements. In the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you, we retain your information for a longer period.\r\n\r\nWhen determining the appropriate retention periods, we take into account factors including:\r\n\r\nour contractual obligations and rights in relation to the information involved;\r\nlegal obligation(s) under applicable law to retain information for a certain period of time;\r\nstatute of limitations under applicable law(s);\r\nour legitimate interests for retaining the information  (please see \u201cUse of Your Information\u201d section);\r\nwhether there is an actual or potential dispute; and\r\nguidelines issued by relevant data protection authorities.\r\nOtherwise, we securely erase your information where we no longer require it for the purposes we collected it for.\r\n\r\n10. Sharing Your Information\r\nThe information we collect about you is transferred to and stored on our servers located within the EU. We are very careful and transparent about who else your information is shared with.\r\n\r\nWe share your information with other Deliveroo group companies only where necessary for the purposes set out in the \u201cUse of Your Information\u201d section above. We share limited information with our partners (such as restaurants, grocers, and other retail partners on Deliveroo), to enable them to fulfil an order. Where relevant  we share information about you with partners to enable them to investigate and respond to complaints.\r\n\r\nWe share your information with third party service providers that provide services on our behalf. The types of third party service providers whom we share your information with include, for example:\r\n\r\npayment providers (including online payment providers and fraud detection providers);\r\nIT service providers (including cloud providers);\r\nthird parties that send direct marketing, market research surveys, and other communications on our behalf;\r\nriders, who have access to limited information to enable them to fulfil an order;\r\ncustomer support providers (including, but not limited to, companies that assist us to provide customer or technical support); and\r\nmarketing and advertising partners.\r\nIf you submit comments and feedback regarding the Sites and services, we share such comments and feedback with our partners as described above (Please see \u201cUse Of Your Information\u201d section). \r\n\r\nWe share your information when we promote a programme or offer a service or product in conjunction with a third-party business partner. We will share your information with that partner to assist in marketing or to provide the associated product or service. In most of those cases, the programme or offer will include the name of the third-party business partner, either alone or with ours. An example of such a business partner relationship would be a partner that we partner with for providing delivery services.\r\n\r\nWe also share your information with our Advertising Partners to:\r\n\r\nhelp us serve ads on users of our Sites based on your behaviour while on our Site and measure your interaction with those ads, and\r\nenable us to serve, and measure, our ads on their sites.\r\nFor more details on how your information may be processed by our Advertising Partners, such as Meta, Google and Criteo please see their respective privacy policies, where you may also find details on how to exercise your data subject rights and option on how to manage your online advertising preferences with them. We may act as joint controllers with Advertising Partners in connection with the processing of information for certain advertising activities as described in their privacy policies. Where we are joint controllers with any Advertising Partners, we enter into an appropriate agreement to set out our respective responsibilities on compliance with applicable data protection obligations in respect of these advertising activities.\r\n\r\nIf you submit comments and feedback regarding the Sites, services, and our partners we share such comments and feedback with our partners. \r\n\r\nDeliveroo will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy and applicable laws when it is transferred to third parties.\r\n\r\nIf our business enters into a joint venture with, purchases or is sold to or merged with another business entity, your information may be disclosed or transferred to the target company, our new business partners or owners or their advisors.\r\n\r\nWe also share your information:\r\n\r\nif we are under a duty to disclose or share your information in order to comply with (and/or where we believe we are under a duty to comply with) any legal obligation or regulatory requirement;\r\nin order to enforce our contractual terms with you and any other agreement;\r\nto protect the rights of Deliveroo, our partners, riders, or others, including to prevent fraud; and\r\nwith such third parties as we reasonably consider necessary in order to prevent crime, e.g. the police or for health and safety purposes.\r\nIn some cases the information we collect from you might be processed outside the European Economic Area or the United Kingdom, such as the United States and the countries in which Deliveroo operates. These countries may not have the same protections for your information as the EEA or the UK has. To the extent these countries have not been lawfully recognised as providing an adequate level of data protection, we will ensure that the information that is processed by us and our suppliers outside of the EEA or the UK is protected in the same way as it would be if it was processed within the EEA or the UK. We ensure to use an appropriate data transfer mechanism, such as reliance on the protections set out in approved standard contractual clauses.\r\n\r\nPlease contact us using the contact details in the \u201cContact Us\u201d section  for further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your information.\r\n\r\nIf you use Deliveroo services in another country where we operate, for example, when you\u2019re travelling, then your information will be processed in accordance with the applicable laws of that country and the Deliveroo privacy policy of that country will apply (available by visiting our website, clicking on \u201cMenu\u201d and scrolling down to select the relevant country).\r\n\r\n11. Security\r\nWe adopt robust technologies and policies to protect your information from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed.\r\n\r\nWe have implemented procedures to deal with any data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will take steps to protect your information, we cannot guarantee the security of your information transmitted to the Sites; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.\r\n\r\nWhen you open an account you may create a password, or other secure login method and also provide payment card details. You must use a unique password and keep any password you create, or other secure login method, secret in order to help prevent others from accessing your account.\r\n\r\n12. Your Rights\r\nUnder certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection law in relation to the information we hold about you.\r\n\r\nThese include:\r\n\r\nThe right of access. This is also known as a \u201cdata subject access request\u201d. You have the right to receive a copy of the information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.\r\nThe right to rectification. You are entitled to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected, though in some cases, we  need to verify the accuracy of the new information you provide to us. \r\nThe right to erasure. This is also known as \u201cthe right to be forgotten\u201d which enables you to request the deletion or removal of certain of the information that we hold about you where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. This right is not absolute and only applies in certain circumstances.\r\nThe right to restrict processing. You have the right to block or suppress further use of your information in certain circumstances. When processing is restricted, we may still have a lawful reason to store your information, but we will not use it further.\r\nThe right to data portability. You have the right to receive your information in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format which you can transfer to another service provider or other third party.This right is not absolute and only applies in certain circumstances.\r\nThe right to withdraw consent. Where we rely on consent to use your information, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time.  Withdrawing consent will not, however, make unlawful our use of your information before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain services to you.\r\nThe right to object to processing. You have the right to object to certain types of processing of your information, including processing for direct marketing purposes and profiling. You can object by changing your marketing preferences and disabling cookies as set out in the \u201cCookies\u201d and \u201cMarketing\u201d sections or by contacting us. \r\nYou have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing of your information, such as in connection with our fraud checks. \r\nTo exercise any of these rights, please contact our Data Protection Officer in writing at dpo@deliveroo.com.\r\n\r\nIf you are unhappy with how we have handled your information you can contact your local data protection authority. In Italy this is the Garante per la protezione dei dati personali. In the UK, this is the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office. We would, however, really appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach your local data protection authority and so we please ask that you contact us first.\r\n\r\n13. Changes To Our Privacy Policy\r\nWe update this privacy policy from time to time, so remember to check back in every so often, in case anything has changed and, where appropriate, we may notify you of the changes, for example by email or push notification.\r\n\r\nThis privacy policy was last updated: 27 June 2023\r\n\r\nDeliveroo Italy srl, Via Carlo Bo 11 Milano 20143, Italy\r\n\r\nRoofoods Ltd, The River Building, 1 Cousin Lane, London, EC4R 3TE, United Kingdom"
