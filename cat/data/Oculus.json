This can include information about you, such as when they send us an abuse report that refers to or contains video of you.\r\n\r\nInformation automatically collected about you when you use Meta VR Products.

For example, we receive information from developers about your achievements in their app and share that information with your friends on Meta Quest. We may also get information from companies or organisations that provide content such as videos, photos and audio.\r\n\r\nYou can learn how to access, correct and delete information that we collect by visiting the Privacy Centre.\r\n\r\n2. How do we use information?\r\nWe use the information as set out below and to provide our Meta VR Products to you and our partners. Here's how:\r\n\r\nTo provide and personalise our Meta VR Products. We use the information that we collect to provide you with our Meta VR Products. For example, we use this information to:\r\n\r\nProvide you with hardware, content, games, apps and other experiences;\r\n\r\nCreate accounts and user profiles;\r\n\r\nCommunicate with you about our Meta VR Products;\r\n\r\nEnable certain features, such as hand tracking;\r\n\r\nEnable content understanding and creation capabilities;\r\n\r\nEnable user-to-user communications and other related services;\r\n\r\nProvide technical support;\r\n\r\nNotify you about updates to our Meta VR Products; and\r\n\r\nCustomise your experiences on our Meta VR Products based on your activities, including the content, games, apps and other experiences that you interact with, the other online services you use and other information that we collect. This allows us to make your experience unique and relevant to you, for example by showing you content that is most relevant to you.\r\n\r\nTo improve and develop your experience and our Meta VR Products. We also use the information that we collect to understand and improve our Meta VR Products and to develop the XR ecosystem. For example, we use the information to:\r\n\r\nSolicit and analyse input and feedback about our Meta VR Products;\r\n\r\nIdentify and address technical issues on our Meta VR Products;\r\n\r\nConduct and learn from research about the ways in which people use our Meta VR Products;\r\n\r\nImprove our AI technologies and support AI research and product development, including content understanding and tools to create content;\r\n\r\nImprove services offered by others, such as third parties that offer content, games, apps and other experiences on our Meta VR Products; and\r\n\r\nImprove and develop our features, such as hand tracking. For example, for hand tracking, we collect technical information such as hand tracking quality, the amount of time it takes to detect your hands and the number of pinches that you make to improve and troubleshoot this feature.\r\n\r\nTo market to you. We use the information that we collect to send you promotional messages and content about Meta VR Products and Meta Quest-related experiences on and off our Meta VR Products. We also use this information to measure how users respond to our marketing efforts. If you would like to opt out of receiving marketing emails, please visit the Privacy Centre.\r\n\r\nTo promote safety, integrity and security. We use the information that we collect to verify accounts and activity, combat harmful conduct, detect and prevent bad experiences, maintain the integrity of our Meta VR Products and promote safety and security on and off our Meta VR Products. For example, we use information collected to investigate suspicious activity or violations of our terms or policies, detect when someone needs help and protect our or others' rights or property.\r\n\r\n3. How is information shared?\r\nOur Meta VR Products help you engage with the XR ecosystem and others who interact with it. To provide and support our Meta VR Products, information that we have about you is shared in certain circumstances. Here is who can see information about you when you and others use our Meta VR Products.\r\n\r\nPeople and accounts that you share and communicate with on our Meta VR Products. When you share, interact and communicate using our Meta VR Products, you choose the audience for what you share. For example, when you share a photo or other content in a shared or public virtual space, other people who visit the space may be able to see it.\r\n\r\nPublic information. Certain information that you post to your Meta Quest profile, such as your Meta Quest ID (also known as your Meta Quest Username) and avatar, will be public and visible to people on and off our Meta VR Products. Your Meta Quest ID is a unique identifier that you choose to identify yourself on our Meta VR Products.\r\nInformation that you post to public areas of our Meta VR Products, such as a forum, blog or other community tool, will also be visible to people on and off our Meta VR Products. If you post information to these interactive features, it will be publicly available. Certain information associated with your public posts, such as the time of your post, will also be published and publicly available.\r\n\r\nContent others share about you. You should consider who you choose to share with, because people who are able to see your activity, content or information on our Meta VR Products may choose to share it with others on and off our Meta VR Products. For example, when you interact with others in a multiplayer game, another player could choose to livestream that experience \u2013 including what you are doing in the game \u2013 to Meta. People may also use Meta VR Products to share content about you that they have obtained from other sources.\r\n\r\nApps, developers and other online content providers on our Meta VR Products. You can interact with third-party content, games, apps and other experiences through our Meta VR Products. We share information about you with these partners so that they can provide you with the experiences that you've requested, such as:\r\n\r\nInformation in your Oculus profile and about how you use our Meta VR Products. For example, we make available to third-party developers a list of your friends who also use the developer's app so that they can offer to pair you in a game or other experience within their app, or rank your scores and achievements in that app against your friends' scores and achievements. We also share information about individual abuse reports or abuse statistics on our Meta VR Products, so we can help develop a safe and enjoyable XR ecosystem.\r\n\r\nInformation about your interaction with the third-party service, such as how long you have interacted with content.\r\n\r\nAny other information that you choose to share with the third party.\r\n\r\nThird-party content providers may also collect information from you directly through the experiences they provide. Please note that any information you share with these or other) third parties will be subject to those third parties' own privacy policies, not this one.\r\n\r\nSharing within related companies. We share information with related companies, including Meta, depending on which services you use, including to promote safety, integrity and security across the Meta Company Products. For example, if you buy something on or through the Meta VR Products, we share your information with Meta Platforms Technologies Ireland Limited to process your payment and detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues in accordance with the Meta Quest Store Terms. We also share information with Meta Platforms Technologies, LLC and Meta Platforms Technologies Ireland Limited to conduct and support research and innovation to further the state-of-the-art or academic understanding of XR technology.\r\n\r\nService providers. We share the information that we collect with vendors, service providers, researchers and other partners, who work at our direction to support the Meta VR Products (such as hosting our Meta VR Products, fulfilling orders, facilitating payments, analysing the way people use our Meta VR Products, processing credit card payments, providing customer service or sending electronic communications for us).\r\n\r\nOther parties in connection with certain business transactions. In the event that the ownership of Meta (or any portion of our assets) changes as a result of a merger, acquisition or in the event of a bankruptcy, information from or about you or your device will be transferred to another company.\r\n\r\nPermission. We share your information for any other purpose you choose.\r\n\r\nLaw enforcement or legal requests. We share information with law enforcement or in response to legal requests in the circumstances outlined in Section 7 below.\r\n\r\nWe also share de-identified or aggregate data with others. De-identified data means information where we have removed your name and other data that could reasonably be used to identify you. Aggregate data is data that has been combined with other data so that it doesn't identify any specific person. For example, we provide developers with aggregated statistics about the number of people from a particular region that use our Meta VR Products, so developers can create content tailored for people in that market\r\n\r\n4. How Oculus works with the rest of Meta .\r\nWe share infrastructure, systems and technology with the rest of Meta (which includes Instagram and WhatsApp) to provide an innovative, relevant, consistent and safe experience across all Meta Products that you use. We also process information about you across Meta for these purposes, as permitted by applicable law and in accordance with their terms and policies. For example, we use information about bad actors on Meta Quest to fight spam or abuse on other Meta Products such as Instagram. We also work to understand how people use and interact with Meta Products, such as understanding the number of unique users on different Meta Products.\r\n\r\n5. Third parties that provide content, marketing or functionality on our services\r\nSome of the content, marketing and functionality on our Meta VR Products is provided by third parties that are not affiliated with us. For example, we work with companies that help us understand how people use our Meta VR Products.\r\n\r\nOther companies may collect information on or through our Meta VR Products to market to you on or off our Meta VR Products. These and other third parties may collect information about your use of our Meta VR Products, including through the use of cookies, device IDs, local storage, pixels and other technologies, and this information may be collected over time and combined with information collected on different websites and online services.\r\n\r\n6. Data retention and deletion\r\nWe store Meta Quest data that identifies you until it is no longer necessary to provide our Meta VR Products or your Oculus account is deleted, whichever comes first, unless retention of the data for a longer period is justified in order to comply with law or recordkeeping obligations, to respond to a legal request, prevent harm or to improve our safety, integrity and security features. This is determined on a case-by-case basis that depends on things such as the nature of the data, why it is collected and processed, and relevant legal, integrity or operational retention needs. For example, we retain certain purchase information for accounting and tax purposes even after you have deleted your account.\r\n\r\nWhen you delete your account, we delete things you have posted and information about apps and entitlements you have downloaded, and you will not be able to recover that information later. Information that others have shared about you is not part of your account and will not be deleted when you delete your account. To delete your account at any time, or to learn more about deleting your account, please visit the Privacy Centre.\r\n\r\n7. How do we respond to legal requests and prevent harm?\r\nWe access, preserve and share information with regulators, law enforcement agencies or others:\r\n\r\nIn response to a legal request if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. We can also respond to legal requests where we have a good faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction and is consistent with internationally recognised standards.\r\n\r\nWhen we have a good faith belief that it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address fraud or other illegal activity; to protect Meta, our Meta VR Products, you and others, including as part of investigations; or to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. For example, if relevant, we exchange information with third-party partners about the reliability of your Oculus account to prevent fraud, abuse and other harmful activity on and off of our Meta VR Products.\r\n\r\nInformation that we receive about you, including financial transaction data related to purchases made on or through our Meta VR Products, can be accessed, processed and retained for an extended period when it is the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation or investigations concerning possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm. We also retain information from Oculus accounts disabled for violations of our terms for at least a year to prevent repeat abuse or other term violations.\r\n\r\n8. How we operate and transfer data as part of our global services\r\nWe share information globally, both internally within Meta, and externally with our partners and with those you connect and share with around the world in accordance with this Policy. Information controlled by Meta Platforms Ireland Limited will be transferred or transmitted to, or stored and processed in the United States or other countries outside of where you live for the purposes as described in this Policy. These data transfers are necessary to provide the services set forth in the Terms of Service and to globally operate and provide our Meta VR Products to you. We use standard contract clauses approved by the European Commission, and rely on the European Commission's adequacy decisions about certain countries, as applicable, for data transfers from the EEA to the United States and other countries.\r\n\r\n9. How will we notify you of changes to this policy?\r\nIf we make changes to this Privacy Policy, we will provide notice of such changes as appropriate, such as by sending you an email notification to the address you've provided, and/or providing notice through the Meta VR Products. If we make an administrative change, we will update the \"Last Updated\" date at the top of this Privacy Policy\r\n\r\n10.
