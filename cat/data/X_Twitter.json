        "plainText": "X Privacy Policy\r\nWe have made some updates to our Privacy Policy. This version of the Privacy Policy will go into effect on September 29, 2023. \r\n\r\n\r\n1. Information We Collect\r\n\r\nThe information we collect when you use Twitter falls into three categories.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.1 Information you provide us.\r\n\r\nTo use some of our products and services you need to have an account, and to create an account, you need to provide us certain information. Likewise, if you use our paid products and services, we cannot provide them to you without getting payment information. Basically, certain information is necessary if you want to use many of our products and services.\r\n\r\nPersonal Accounts. If you create an account, you must provide us with some information so that we can provide our services to you. This includes a display name (for example, \u201cTwitter Moments\u201d); a username (for example, @TwitterMoments); a password; an email address or phone number; a date of birth; your display language; and third-party single sign-in information (if you choose this sign-in method). You can also choose to share your location in your profile and Tweets, and to upload your address book to Twitter to help find people you may know. Your profile information, which includes your display name and username, is always public, but you can use either your real name or a pseudonym. And remember, you can create multiple Twitter accounts, for example, to express different parts of your identity, professional or otherwise. \r\n\r\nProfessional Accounts. If you create a professional account, you also need to provide us with a professional category, and may provide us with other information, including street address, contact email address, and contact phone number, all of which will always be public. \r\n\r\nPayment Information. In order to purchase ads or other offerings provided as part of our paid products and services you will need to provide us payment information, including your credit or debit card number, card expiration date, CVV code, and billing address.\r\n\r\nPreferences. When you set your preferences using your settings, we collect that information so that we can respect your preferences.\r\n\r\n1.2 Information we collect when you use X.\r\nA trio of blue interlocking gears with the Twitter logo in the center, encircled by various information types like location pins and cookies.\r\nWhen you use our services, we collect information about how you use our products and services. We use that information to provide you with products and services, to help keep X more secure and respectful for everyone, and more relevant to you.\r\n \r\n\r\nUsage Information. We collect information about your activity on X, including:\r\n\r\nPosts and other content you post (including the date, application, and version of X) and information about your broadcast activity (e.g., Spaces), including broadcasts you\u2019ve created and when you created them, your lists, bookmarks, and communities you are a part of.\r\nYour interactions with other users\u2019 content, such as reposts, likes, bookmarks, shares, replies, if other users mention or tag you in content or if you mention or tag them, and broadcasts you\u2019ve participated in (including your viewing history, listening, commenting, speaking, and reacting).\r\nHow you interact with others on the platform, such as people you follow and people who follow you, metadata related to Encrypted Messages, and when you use Direct Messages, including the contents of the messages, the recipients, and date and time of messages.\r\nIf you communicate with us, such as through email, we will collect information about the communication and its content.\r\nWe collect information on links you interact with across our services (including in our emails sent to you).\r\nPurchase and payments. To allow you to make a payment or send money using X features or services, including through an intermediary, we may receive information about your transaction such as when it was made, when a subscription is set to expire or auto-renew, and amounts paid or received.\r\n\r\nDevice Information. We collect information from and about the devices you use to access X, including:\r\n\r\nInformation about your connection, such as your IP address, browser type, and related information.\r\nInformation about your device and its settings, such as device and advertising ID, operating system, carrier, language, memory, apps installed, and battery level.\r\nYour device address book, if you\u2019ve chosen to share it with us.\r\nA cell phone screen shining on a globe with orange and gray location pins scattered around. \r\nLocation Information. When you use X, we collect some information about your approximate location to provide the service you expect, including showing you relevant ads. You can also choose to share your current precise location or places where you\u2019ve previously used X by enabling these settings in your account.\r\n\r\n\r\nInferred Identity. We may collect or receive information that we use to infer your identity as detailed below:\r\nWhen you sign into X on a browser or device, we will associate that browser or device with your account. Subject to your settings, we may also associate your account with browsers or devices other than those you use to sign into X (or associate your signed-out device or browser with other browsers or devices or X-generated identifiers).\r\nWhen you provide other information to X, including an email address or phone number, we associate that information with your X account. Subject to your settings, we may also use this information in order to infer other information about your identity, for example by associating your account with hashes of email addresses that share common components with the email address you have provided to X.\r\nWhen you access X and are not signed in, we may infer your identity based on the information we collect.\r\nA laptop and cell phone showing screens of computer code, alongside icons representing various information types.\r\nLog Information. We may receive information when you view content on or otherwise interact with our products and services, even if you have not created an account or are signed out, such as:\r\n\r\nIP address and related information; browser type and language; operating system; the referring webpage; access times; pages visited; location; your mobile carrier; device information (including device and application IDs); search terms and IDs (including those not submitted as queries); ads shown to you on X; X-generated identifiers; and identifiers associated with cookies. We also receive log information when you click on, view, or interact with links on our services, including when you install another application through X.\r\n\r\nAdvertisements. When you view or interact with ads we serve on or off X, we may collect information about those views or interactions (e.g., watching a video ad or preroll, clicking on an ad, interacting with reposts of or replies to an ad). \r\nCookies and similar technologies. Like many websites, we use cookies and similar technologies to collect additional website usage data and to operate our services. Cookies are not required for many parts of our products and services such as searching and looking at public profiles. You can learn more about how we use cookies and similar technologies here.\r\n\r\nInteractions with our content on third-party sites. When you view our content on third-party websites that integrate X content such as embedded timelines or post buttons, we may receive log information that includes the web page you visited.\r\n \r\n 1.3 Information we receive from third parties.\r\n\r\nWhen you use other online products and services, they may share information about that usage with us.\r\n\r\nAd Partners, Developers, Publishers. Our ad and business partners share information with us such as browser cookie IDs, X-generated identifiers, mobile device IDs, hashed user information like email addresses, demographic or interest data, and content viewed or actions taken on a website or app. Some of our ad partners, particularly our advertisers, also enable us to collect similar information directly from their website or app by integrating our advertising technology. Information shared by ad partners and affiliates or collected by X from the websites and apps of ad partners and affiliates may be combined with the other information you share with X and that X receives, generates, or infers about you described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy.\r\n\r\nOther Third Parties, Account Connections, and Integrations. We may receive information about you from third parties who are not our ad partners, such as other X users, developers, and partners who help us evaluate the safety and quality of content on our platform, our corporate affiliates, and other services you link to your X account. You may choose to connect your X account to your account on another service, and that other service may send us information about your account on that service.\r\n\r\n2. How We Use Information\r\n\r\nBreaking down how we use the information we collect is not simple because of the way the systems that bring our services to you work. For example, the same piece of information may be used differently for different purposes to ultimately deliver a single service. We think it\u2019s most useful to describe the five main ways we use information and if you have questions that are not answered, you can always contact us. Here we go:\r\n\r\n\r\n2.1 Operate, improve, and personalize our services.\r\n\r\nWe use the information we collect to provide and operate X products and services. We also use the information we collect to improve and personalize our products and services so that you have a better experience on X, including by showing you more relevant content and ads, suggesting people and topics to follow, enabling and helping you discover affiliates, third-party apps, and services. We may use the information we collect and publicly available information to help train our machine learning or artificial intelligence models for the purposes outlined in this policy.\r\n\r\nWe may use the information we collect from accounts of other services that you choose to connect your X account to provide you features like cross-posting or cross-service authentication, and to operate our services.\r\n\r\nWe use your contact information to help others find your account if your settings permit, including through third-party services and client applications.\r\n\r\nTwo toggle switches in the on/off states with various data representation icons inside. The green \u201con\u201d toggle is filled with more icons than the grayscale \u201coff\u201d toggle.\r\nWe use your information to provide our advertising and sponsored content services subject to your settings, which helps make ads on X more relevant to you. We also use this information to measure the effectiveness of ads and to help recognize your devices to serve you ads on and off of X. Some of our ad partners also enable us to collect similar information directly from their website or app by integrating our advertising technology. Information shared by ad partners and affiliates or collected by X from the websites and apps of ad partners and affiliates may be combined with the other information you share with X and that X receives, generates, or infers about you, as described elsewhere in our Privacy Policy.\r\n\r\n2.2 Foster safety and security.\r\n\r\nWe use information we collect to provide for the safety and security of our users, our products, services, and your account. This includes verifying your identity, authenticating your account, and defending against fraud, unauthorized use, and illegal activity. We also use the information to evaluate and affect the safety and quality of content on X - this includes investigating and enforcing our policies and and terms, as well as applicable law.\r\n\r\n2.3 Measure, analyze and make our services better.\r\n\r\nWe use the information we collect to measure and analyze the effectiveness of our products and services and to better understand how you use them in order to make them better.\r\n\r\n2.4 Communicate with you about our services.\r\n\r\nWe use the information we collect to communicate with you about our products and services, including about product updates and changes to our policies and terms. If you\u2019re open to hearing from us, we may also send you marketing messages from time to time.\r\n\r\n2.5 Research.\r\n\r\nWe use information you share with us, or that we collect to conduct research, surveys, product testing, and troubleshooting to help us operate and improve our products and services.\r\n\r\n3. Sharing Information\r\n\r\nYou should know the ways we share your information, why we share it, and how you can control it. There are five general ways we share your information.\r\n\r\n3.1 When you post and share.\r\n\r\nWith the general public. You are directing us to disclose that information as broadly as possible. X content, including your profile information (e.g., name/pseudonym, username, profile pictures), is available for viewing by the general public. The public does not need to be signed in to view some content on X. They may also find X content off of X, for example from search query results on Internet search engines.\r\n\r\nWith other X users. Depending on your settings, and based on the X products and services you use, we share:\r\n\r\nYour interactions with X content of other users, such as likes, and people you follow.\r\nContent you send to a specific X user, such as through Direct Messages. Please keep in mind that if you\u2019ve shared information like Direct Messages or protected posts with someone else who accesses X through a third-party service, the information may be shared with the third-party service.\r\nWith partners. Depending on your settings, we also provide certain third parties with information to help us offer or operate our products and services. You can learn more about these partnerships in our Help Center. You can control whether X shares your personal information with these partners by using the \u201cData sharing with business partners\u201d option in your Privacy & Safety settings. (This setting does not control sharing described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, such as when we share information with our service providers, or through partnerships other than as described in this Help Center article.)\r\n\r\n3.2 With third parties & third-party integrations.\r\n\r\nWith service providers. We may share your information with our service providers that perform functions and provide services on our behalf, including payment services providers who facilitate payments; service providers that host our various blogs and wikis; service providers that help us understand the use of our services; applicant tracking system providers to send and receive applicant and job data to potential employers; and those that provide fraud detection services. \r\n\r\nWith advertisers. Advertising revenue enables us to provide our products and services. Advertisers may learn information from your engagement with their ads on or off X. For example, if you click on an external link or ad on our services, that advertiser or website operator might figure out that you came from X, along with other information associated with the ad you clicked, such as characteristics of the audience it was intended to reach and other X-generated identifiers for that ad. They may also collect other personal information from you, such as cookie identifiers, or your IP address.\r\n\r\nThird-party content & integrations. We share or disclose your information with your consent or at your direction, such as when you authorize a third-party web client or application to access your account or when you direct us to share your feedback with a business. Similarly, to improve your experience, we work with third-party partners to display their video content on X or to allow cross-platform sharing. When you watch or otherwise interact with content from our video or cross-platform sharing partners, they may receive and process your personal information as described in their privacy policies. For video content, you can adjust your autoplay settings if you prefer that content not to play automatically.\r\n\r\nThrough our APIs. We use technology like APIs and embeds to make public X information available to websites, apps, and others for their use, for example, displaying posts on a news website or analyzing what people say on X. We generally make this content available in limited quantities for free and charge licensing fees for large-scale access. We have standard terms that govern how this information can be used, and a compliance program to enforce these terms. But these individuals and companies are not affiliated with X, and their offerings may not reflect updates you make on X. For more information about how we make public data on X available to the world, visit https://developer.x.com.\r\n \r\n3.3 When required by law, to prevent harm, or in the public interest.\r\n\r\nWe may preserve, use, share, or disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to:\r\n\r\ncomply with a law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request;\r\n\r\nprotect the safety of any person, protect the safety or integrity of our platform, including to help prevent spam, abuse, or malicious actors on our services;\r\n\r\nexplain why we have removed content or accounts from our services (e.g., for a violation of Our Rules);\r\n\r\naddress fraud, security, or technical issues; or\r\n\r\nprotect our rights or property, or the rights or property of those who use our services.\r\n\r\n3.4 With our Affiliates.\r\n\r\nWe may share information amongst our affiliates to provide our products and services.\r\n\r\n3.5 As a result of a change in ownership.\r\n\r\nWe may share, sell, or transfer information about you in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization, sale of assets, or bankruptcy. This Privacy Policy will apply to your personal information that is shared with (before and after the close of any transaction) or transferred to the new entity.\r\n\r\n4. How Long We Keep Information\r\n\r\nWe keep different types of information for different periods of time: \r\n\r\nWe keep your profile information and content for the duration of your account.\r\n\r\nWe generally keep other personally identifiable data we collect when you use our products and services for a maximum of 18 months.\r\n\r\nRemember public content can exist elsewhere even after you remove it from X. For example, search engines and other third parties may retain copies of your posts longer, based upon their own privacy policies, even after they are deleted or expire on X. You can read more about search visibility here.\r\n\r\nWhere you violate our Rules and your account is suspended, we may keep the identifiers you used to create the account (i.e., email address or phone number) indefinitely to prevent repeat policy offenders from creating new accounts.\r\n\r\nWe may keep certain information longer than our policies specify in order to comply with legal requirements and for safety and security reasons.\r\n\r\n5. Take Control\r\n\r\n5.1 Access, Correction, Portability.\r\n\r\nYou can access, correct, or modify the information you provided to us by editing your profile and adjusting your account settings.\r\n\r\nYou can learn more about the information we have collected or inferred about you in Your X Data and request access to additional information here.\r\n\r\nYou can download a copy of your information, such as your posts, by following the instructions here.\r\n\r\nTo protect your privacy and maintain security, we take steps to verify your identity before granting you access to your personal information or complying with a deletion, portability, or other related request. We may, in certain situations, reject your request for access, correction, or portability, for example, we may reject access where you are unable to verify your identity.\r\n\r\n5.2 Deleting your Information.\r\n\r\nIf you follow the instructions here, your account will be deactivated and your data will be queued for deletion. When deactivated, your X account, including your display name, username, and public profile, will no longer be viewable on X.com, X for iOS, and X for Android. For up to 30 days after deactivation it is still possible to restore your X account if it was accidentally or wrongfully deactivated.\r\n\r\n5.3 Objecting to, Restricting, or Withdrawing your Consent.\r\n\r\nYou can manage your privacy settings and other account features here. If you change your settings it may take some time for your choices to be fully reflected throughout our systems. You may also notice changes in your X experience or limitations in your ability to access certain features depending on the settings you\u2019ve adjusted. You may also manage additional settings when interacting with certain content and features on different parts of the platform, such as whether a Space is recorded, or whether videos you upload are downloadable by others.\r\n\r\nX adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (also referred to as \u201cinterest-based advertising\u201d) and respects the DAA\u2019s consumer choice tool for you to opt out of interest-based advertising at https://optout.aboutads.info/.\r\n\r\n5.4 Authorized Agent Requests.\r\n\r\nTo submit a request related to access, modification, or deletion of your information, or someone else\u2019s information if you are their authorized agent, you may also contact us as specified in the How To Contact X section of our Privacy Policy below. We may require you to provide additional information for verification.\r\n\r\n6. Your Rights and Ours\r\n\r\nWe provide X to people all over the world and provide many of the same privacy tools and controls to all of our users regardless of where they live. However, your experience may be slightly different than users in other countries to ensure X respects local requirements.\r\n\r\n6.1 We have specific legal bases to use your information.\r\n\r\nX has carefully considered the legal reasons it is permitted to collect, use, share and otherwise process your information. If you want to dig in to learn more and better understand the nuances, we\u2019d encourage you to check out this additional information about data processing. And no, we don\u2019t sell your personal information. \r\n\r\n6.2 We move your data to make X work for you.\r\n\r\nJust as you use X to seamlessly participate in global conversations with people in countries all over the world, X must move information across borders and to different countries around the world to support the safe and reliable service you depend on. For example, if you live in Europe and are having a conversation with someone in the United States, information has to move between those countries to provide that experience \u2013 it\u2019s what you expect from us.\r\n\r\nWe also use data centers and cloud providers, and engage our affiliates and third-party partners and service providers located in many parts of the world to help us provide our services. Before we move data between countries we look at the risks that may be presented to the data and rely on things like standard contractual clauses, where applicable, to ensure your data rights are protected. If data will be shared with a third party, we require them to maintain the same protections over your data that we provide directly.\r\n\r\n7. X's Audience\r\n\r\nOur services are not directed to children, and you may not use our services if you are under the age of 13. You must also be old enough to consent to the processing of your personal data in your country (in some countries we may allow your parent or guardian to do so on your behalf).\r\n\r\n8. Changes To This Privacy Policy\r\nThe most current version of this Privacy Policy governs our processing of your personal data and we may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time as needed.\r\n\r\nIf we do revise this Privacy Policy and make changes that are determined by us to be material, we will provide you notice and an opportunity to review the revised Privacy Policy before you continue to use X.\r\n\r\n9. General\r\nThe X Privacy Policy is written in English but is made available in multiple languages through translations. X strives to make the translations as accurate as possible to the original English version. However, in case of any discrepancies or inconsistencies, the English language version of the X Privacy Policy shall take precedence. You acknowledge that English shall be the language of reference for interpreting and constructing the terms of the X Privacy Policy. \r\n\r\n10. How To Contact X\r\n\r\nWe want to hear from you if you have thoughts or questions about this Privacy Policy. You can contact us via our Privacy Policy Inquiries page or by writing to us at the appropriate address below. Information about our handling of California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) requests is available here.\r\n\r\nIf you live in the United States or any other country outside of the European Union, EFTA States, or the United Kingdom, the data controller responsible for your personal data is X Corp., with an address of: \r\nX Corp.\r\nAttn: Privacy Policy Inquiry\r\n1355 Market Street, Suite 900\r\nSan Francisco, CA 94103\r\n\r\nIf you live in the European Union, EFTA States, or the United Kingdom, the data controller is Twitter International Unlimited Company, with an address of: \r\nTwitter International Unlimited Company\r\nAttn: Data Protection Officer\r\nOne Cumberland Place, Fenian Street\r\nDublin 2, D02 AX07 IRELAND\r\n\r\nYou can confidentially contact X's Data Protection Officer through our Data Protection Inquiry Form. If you wish to raise a concern about our data processing practices, you have the right to do so with your local supervisory authority or Twitter International Unlimited Company\u2019s lead supervisory authority, the Irish Data Protection Commission, using the contact details listed on their website.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUPPLEMENTARY TEXT FROM EXTERNAL PAGES LINKED IN THE PRIVACY POLICY\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional information about data processing\r\n\r\nThis supplements the X Privacy Policy to provide additional information about the types of data we collect, where we get it, and how we process and share it.\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nData processing summary\r\n\r\nThe table below contains a list of the general purposes for which we process personal data. For data from the European Union, EFTA States, and the United Kingdom, the third column in the table below contains the primary legal bases we rely on for such processing. \r\n\r\nSome processing activities may be accounted for in multiple rows if the processing or data involved is sufficiently distinct. For example, advertising revenues allow us to support and improve our services. To provide this advertising we process some of your data, and for data from the European Union, EFTA States, and the United Kingdom we rely on legitimate interests as the legal basis for doing so. We also offer you the ability to further personalize the ads you see based on data we receive about you from our advertising partners. If you are located in the European Union, an EFTA State, or the United Kingdom, we rely on consent as our legal basis for processing your data to provide these ads.\r\n\r\nPROCESSING PURPOSE / DATA / PRIMARY LEGAL BASIS/BASES FOR PROCESSING PERSONAL DATA FROM THE EU, EFTA STATES, AND UK\r\n______________________________________\r\n\r\nPROCESSING PURPOSE:\r\nOperating our services, including:\r\n    -

This provides you an opportunity to appeal a verification decision and for X to review your appeal.\r\n\r\nData extracted from the ID, image of your ID, and the selfie may be kept for 30 days in connection with identity verification for the Creator Subscriptions or Ads Revenue Share programs. The full name, address extracted from the ID, when possible, and hashed government ID number for identity verification for these programs will be stored by X for as long as you participate in the programs to help protect users from fraud and payment manipulation. \r\n\r\nWho stores the data & who we share with:\r\nX does not directly store this data in connection with the optional X Premium and Safety and Security purposes, including impersonation. X directly stores the full name, a hash of the document ID number and address extracted from the ID in connection with identity verification for the Creator Subscriptions or Ads Revenue Share programs. In all use cases, X shares the data with Au10tix, who acts as our data processor. Au10tix processes and stores the data as detailed above.\r\n\r\nLEGAL BASIS:\r\nConsent\r\n______________________________________\r\n\r\n* We do not collect X for Web data from browsers that we believe to be located in the European Union or the European Economic Area.\r\n\r\n** We set and use cookies as described in Our use of cookies and similar technologies, and if you are in the European Union, an EFTA State, or the United Kingdom with your consent as provided for under Directive 95/46/EC.\r\n\r\n*** X also shares non-public personal information with advertisers that are not acting as data processors in order to enable those advertisers to measure their own advertising. As described above, X treats such partnerships as consent-based data processing and X customers located in the European Union, an EFTA state, or the United Kingdom must have their  \u201cAllow additional information sharing with business partners\u201d setting enabled in order for X and its data processors to share their non-public personal information with non-data-processors in such circumstances.\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nLegitimate interests analysis summary \u2013 inferences about your account\r\n \r\nX uses information that individuals provide and data that it receives (as described in X\u2019s Privacy Policy) to make inferences about the people who use X and content on the platform. This includes inferences like what topics people may be interested in, how old a person is, what languages a person speaks, and whether the content of one account may be of interest to others on the platform. This helps X offer better services and personalize the content X shows, including ads.\r\n\r\nWithout these inferences, people would have a harder time finding content that interested them, X would have a more difficult time keeping the platform safe and enjoyable for everyone, and X\u2019s advertising would be less compelling to those who saw it and less valuable to X\u2019s business customers.\r\n\r\nTo safeguard the rights of those who use our services, if an individual wishes to review and modify information that X has inferred about them, that individual may do so by using Your X data. This service is available both to individuals with a X account and those who do not have an account or are logged out of X. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nLegitimate interests analysis summary \u2013 advertising we show you on X based on data you provide or we collect on X, or on other websites or mobile apps based on information collected there\r\n\r\nX uses information that individuals provide and data that it receives during the individual\u2019s use of X (as described in X\u2019s Privacy Policy) to improve the quality of the ads the individual sees on the platform. When X shows ads in other apps or websites, X uses information from that app or website to improve the quality of the ads the individual sees.\r\n\r\nThis enables X to give individuals a better product experience that is more in line with their interests and the content they find most meaningful and relevant to them, and to provide more valuable advertising offerings that generate revenue to support and improve its services. Without this processing, X\u2019s advertising would be less compelling to those who saw it and less valuable to X\u2019s business customers.\r\n\r\nTo safeguard the rights of those who use our services, X offers individuals a variety of controls over the ads they see on X.  Individuals may block or mute specific advertisers if they do not wish to see ads from those advertisers, report bad or offensive ads, and flag ads that they do not like. In addition, every ad on X provides a dropdown \u201cWhy am I seeing this ad?\u201d option to let the individual see the basis on which the ad was shown to them, such as inferred age, gender, and interests. The individual may then modify that information in Your X data to affect future ads that they see. This service is available both to individuals with a X account and those who do not have an account or are logged out of X.\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nLegitimate interests analysis summary \u2013 Measuring the effectiveness of advertising we show you\r\n\r\nX uses information that individuals provide and data that it receives (as described in X\u2019s Privacy Policy) to measure the effectiveness of the advertising X shows to individuals. \r\n\r\nThis enables X to give advertisers a means of better understanding the performance of the advertising they purchase through X. Such advertising measurement offerings are a critical component of X\u2019s business because they enable advertisers to make informed decisions about what kinds of advertisements they should run, when they should run them, what kinds of content they should include, and the audiences they should try to reach. Without this processing, X\u2019s advertising would be less compelling to those who saw it and less valuable to X\u2019s business customers.\r\n\r\nTo safeguard the rights of those who use our services, X primarily offers advertising measurement through data processor partnerships that generate reports for advertisers about key performance indicators of their X advertising campaigns. These data processors are subject to a number of contractual restrictions around how they are permitted to process data received from X, including that they are prohibited from sharing with third parties that are not acting as data processors any X data that by itself can be used to identify an individual. \r\n\r\nX also shares non-public personal information with advertisers that are not acting as data processors in order to enable those advertisers to measure their own advertising. As described above, X treats such partnerships as consent-based data processing and X customers located in the European Union, an EFTA state, or the United Kingdom must have their  \u201cAllow additional information sharing with business partners\u201d setting enabled in order for X and its data processors to share their non-public personal information with non-data-processors in such circumstances.\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nLegitimate interests analysis summary \u2013 enabling advertisers to exclude an advertiser-submitted audience from being eligible for an advertising campaign\r\n\r\nX uses information that individuals provide and data that it receives (as described in X\u2019s Privacy Policy) to enable advertisers to exclude an advertiser-submitted audience from being eligible for an advertising campaign. \r\n\r\nThis enables X to give advertisers a way to avoid showing their ads to people who are irrelevant to the goals of their campaigns (e.g., people who have already installed the advertiser\u2019s game). This feature is a critical component of X\u2019s business because it helps X serve fewer irrelevant ads and enables X advertisers to effectively run advertising campaigns at scale while reducing bad user experiences with irrelevant ads and wasting money serving ads to users who have already taken the action being advertised. Without this processing, X\u2019s advertising would be less compelling to those who saw it and less valuable to X\u2019s business customers, some of whom would not run advertising campaigns on X at all.\r\n\r\nTo safeguard the rights of those who use our services, X implements technical measures, contracts, and policies to disclose this processing, separate out the personal data processed only for this purpose, minimize the amount and type of personal data processed for this purpose, and avoid processing of personal data based on categories that may be sensitive or are prohibited by law, such as race, religion, politics, sex life, or health.\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nLegitimate interests analysis summary \u2013 non-service related notifications about your X activity, related content, Direct Messages, and other X product features\r\n\r\nX uses information that individuals provide and data that it receives (as described in X\u2019s Privacy Policy) to send non-service related notifications to X account holders about their X activity, related content, Direct Messages, and other X product features. This enables X to provide information that individuals may find valuable or useful, such as posts or Direct Messages directed to the individual, analytics about content the individual authored, and new product features.\r\n\r\nWithout these notifications, people would have a harder time learning of content relevant to them on X, would receive less feedback about their content on X, and would potentially miss out on conversations with others on X.\r\n\r\nTo safeguard the rights of those who use our services, each non-service related email notification contains an opt out link that enables the individual to disable any or all such notifications. An individual can similarly update his or her preferences at any time while logged into X.com or our mobile apps. For individuals in the European Union, an EFTA State, and the United Kingdom, control is also provided during the registration process in which the individual\u2019s email address is first collected.\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nSources of personal data we process\r\n \r\nThe table below describes the categories of sources from which we may receive personal data. \r\n\r\nDATA CATEGORY / DATA / SOURCE(S)\r\n______________________________________\r\n\r\nDATA CATEGORY:\r\n    Online Activity\r\n    (Internet and other electronic network activity information, including, but not limited to, information regarding interactions with websites, applications, or advertisements)\r\n\r\nDATA:\r\n    -
