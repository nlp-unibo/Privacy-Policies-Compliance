You will find information on your right to object to this processing of your data below under section 8. Rights as a data subject.\r\n\r\n \r\n6. International data transfers  \r\nSome recipients of your personal data are located outside your country or have offices in countries where data protection laws may provide a different level of protection than the laws in your country. When transferring personal data to such recipients, we provide appropriate safeguards.\r\n\r\nLearn more about section 6\r\n6.1 Data transfers to eBay Affiliates\r\nThe transmission of personal data between eBay Affiliates (e.g. to enable cross border transactions and for other legally permitted purposes) is based on our worldwide data protection principles, which are binding internal data protection regulations (Binding Corporate Rules, BCRs), or on the basis of other appropriate safeguards (e.g. standard data protection clauses issued or approved by the European Commission (2021/914/EU). Through our Binding Corporate Rules, eBay Affiliates undertake to protect your personal data and to comply with data protection obligations. Further information on our binding company-wide guidelines and our worldwide data protection principles can be found in the eBay Privacy Centre.\r\n\r\n6.2 Other data transfers (from the European Economic Area to third countries)\r\nWe may transfer your personal data to recipients (see section 5. Purposes and legal basis for data processing and categories of recipients) who may be located anywhere in the world. We will only transfer your personal data from the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom or Switzerland to third countries, i.e. countries outside the EEA, on the basis of appropriate safeguards or if otherwise authorised by applicable law. Third countries providing an adequate level of data protection according to the European Commission currently include Andorra, Argentina, Canada (for companies covered by the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act), Switzerland (for transfers out of the EEA), the Faroe Islands, Guernsey, the State of Israel, the Isle of Man, Japan, Jersey, New Zealand, South Korea, the United Kingdom and Uruguay. In other cases, eBay provides the necessary safeguards, e.g. through the conclusion of data protection contracts adopted by the European Commission (e.g. standard data protection clauses (2021/914/EU) with the recipients, or through other measures provided for by law. Additional information regarding the measures taken by us is available on request. We regularly re-evaluate the measures taken to assess requirements deriving from new regulatory guidance and case law, e.g. from the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) decision in the matter C-311/18.\r\n\r\n \r\n7. Storage duration and erasure  \r\nYour personal data will be stored by us and our service providers in accordance with applicable data protection laws to the extent necessary for the processing purposes set out in this User Privacy Notice (see section 5. Purposes and legal basis for data processing and categories of recipients for more information on the processing purposes). Subsequently, we will delete your personal data in accordance with our data retention and deletion policy or take steps to properly render the data anonymous, unless we are legally obliged or permitted to keep your personal data longer (e.g. for legal compliance, tax, accounting or auditing purposes, or to detect and prevent fraudulent or illegal activity on eBay). In Europe, the retention periods are generally between 6 and 10 years (e.g. for contracts, notifications and business letters). As far as legally permissible or required, we restrict the processing of your data instead of deleting it (e.g. by restricting access to it). This applies in particular to cases where we may still need the data for the execution of the contract or for the assertion of or defence against legal claims, or where such retention is otherwise required or permitted by law. In these cases, the duration of the restriction of processing depends on the respective statutory limitation or retention periods. The data will be deleted after the relevant limitation or retention periods have expired.\r\n\r\nLearn more about section 7\r\nThe specific retention periods for personal data are documented in our regional data retention guidelines. How long we retain personal data may vary depending on the Services we provide and our legal obligations under applicable national law. The following factors typically affect the retention period:\r\n\r\nNecessity for the provision of our Services\r\nThis includes such things as executing the User Agreement with you, maintaining and improving the performance of our products, keeping our systems secure, and maintaining appropriate business and financial records. Most of our retention periods are determined on the basis of this general rule.\r\nConsent-based processing of personal data\r\nIf we process personal data on the basis of consent (including consent to the extended storage), we store the data for as long as necessary in order to process it according to your consent.\r\nStatutory, contractual or other similar obligations\r\nCorresponding storage obligations may arise, for example, from laws or official orders. It may also be necessary to store personal data with regard to pending or future legal disputes. Personal data contained in contracts, notifications and business letters may be subject to statutory storage obligations depending on national law.\r\n \r\n8. Rights as a data subject  \r\nSubject to possible restrictions under national law, as a data subject, you have the right to access, rectification, erasure, restriction of processing and data portability with regard to your personal data. In addition, you can withdraw your consent and object to our processing of your personal data on the basis of our legitimate interests. You can also lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.\r\n\r\nLearn more about section 8\r\nYour rights in detail:\r\n\r\nWhere we rely on consent you can withdraw your consent to the processing of your personal data by us at any time. As a result, we may no longer process your personal data based on this consent in the future. The withdrawal of consent has no effect on the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.\r\nYou have the right to obtain access to your personal data that is being processed by us. In particular, you may request information on the purposes of the processing, the categories of personal data concerned, the categories of recipients to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed, where possible the envisaged period for which the personal data will be stored or the criteria used to determine that period, the existence of the right to request rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing of personal data or to object to such processing, the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, any available information as to the personal data's source (where they are not collected from you), the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling and, where appropriate, meaningful information on its details. Your right to access shall not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others. Your right to access may be limited by national law.\r\nYou have the right to obtain from us without undue delay the rectification of inaccurate personal data concerning you. Taking into account the purposes of the processing, you have the right to have incomplete personal data completed, including by means of providing a supplementary statement.\r\nYou have the right to obtain from us the erasure of personal data concerning you under certain conditions (e.g. when the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were processed or when they are no longer required for overriding legitimate grounds, such as the detection/prevention of fraud), unless processing is necessary for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information, for compliance with a legal obligation, for reasons of public interest or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. The right to erasure may be limited by national law.\r\nYou have the right to obtain from us restriction of processing your personal data to the extent that\r\nthe accuracy of the data is disputed by you,\r\nthe processing is unlawful, but you oppose the erasure of the personal data,\r\nwe no longer need the data, but you need it to assert, exercise or defend legal claims or\r\nyou have objected to the processing.\r\nYou have the right to receive the personal data concerning you, which you have provided to us, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and have the right to transmit those data to another controller (\"right to data portability\").\r\nYou have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. As a rule, you can contact the supervisory authority of your usual place of residence, your place of work or the registered office of the controller.\r\nIf your personal data is processed on the basis of our legitimate interests, you have the right to object to the processing of your personal data on grounds relating to your particular situation. This also applies to profiling. If your personal data is processed by us for direct marketing purposes, you have the right to object at any time to the processing of your personal data for such marketing, which includes profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing.\r\n\r\nExercising your rights and managing your settings\r\nYou can exercise your rights as a data subject via our Privacy Contact page. In addition, you are of course free to contact the eBay Privacy Team or the controller who is responsible for the processing of your personal data at any time (for further information, see section 2. Controller above). You can find all necessary information and contact details in our eBay Privacy Center.\r\n\r\nThe exercise of the above data subjects' rights (e.g. right to access or erasure) is generally free of charge. Where requests are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of their repetitive character, we may charge an appropriate fee (at most our actual costs), in accordance with the applicable statutory regulations, or refuse to process the application.\r\n\r\nManaging your communication preferences\r\n\r\nIf you would like to change your preferences regarding eBay communications (including marketing communications), you can do so at any time through your account in My eBay under \"Communication Preferences\". If you no longer wish to receive email marketing communications from us, you can also unsubscribe by clicking on the link in the footer of the email you received. For technical reasons, the implementation may take a few days. For information on how to manage your cookies and similar technologies preferences, see the next section 9. Cookies & similar technologies.\r\n\r\n \r\n9. Cookies & similar technologies  \r\nWhen you use our Services, we and authorised third parties make use of cookies and similar technologies (which we will refer to collectively as \"cookies\") to provide you with a better, faster and safer user experience or to show you personalised advertising. You can find detailed information about the use of cookies and similar technologies and your choices in our User Cookie Notice.\r\n\r\nLearn more about section 9\r\nThe cookies and similar technologies used in connection with the Services have different functions:\r\n\r\nThey may be technically necessary for the provision of our Services\r\nThey help us optimise our Services technically (e.g. monitoring of error messages and loading times)\r\nThey help us improve your user experience (e.g. save font size and form data entered)\r\nThey allow us to show you more relevant advertisements\r\nWe use cookies and similar technologies that remain on your device only as long as your browser is active (session cookies), as well as cookies and similar technologies that remain on your device longer (persistent cookies). We take appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorised access to our cookies and similar technologies.\r\n\r\nYour choices regarding cookies and similar technologies\r\nPlease see our User Cookie Notice for more information and your choices with respect to cookies and similar technologies, or go directly to Advertising and related preferences (users in the EEA, Switzerland and the United Kingdom) or AdChoice - eBay Advertising Preferences (all users) to manage your preferences.\r\n\r\nYou are also free to disable the use of cookies and similar technologies if this is supported by your device. You can manage your cookie settings in your browser or device settings.\r\n\r\nYou can find information about third-party cookies (and similar technologies) related to advertising and how to prevent their use on the following websites:\r\n\r\nwww.youronlinechoices.com\r\nwww.aboutads.info/choices (only available in English)\r\nwww.networkadvertising.org/choices (only available in English)\r\nIf you decide not to allow third parties to process your personal data for advertising purposes via cookies (and similar technologies), this does not mean that we will not show you advertisements. It simply means that these advertisements will not be personalised for you using cookies or similar technologies.\r\n\r\n \r\n10. Data security  \r\nWe protect your personal data through technical and organisational security measures to minimise risks associated with data loss, misuse, unauthorised access and unauthorised disclosure and alteration. To this end we use network security services and data encryption, for example, as well as physical access restrictions for our data centres and logical access controls for data and systems access. You can find further information on our data security in our Security Centre.\r\n\r\n \r\n11. Other important information regarding data protection\r\nThis section contains important additional information about the protection of personal data in connection with the use of our Services, including whether you are required to provide personal data.\r\n\r\nLearn more about section 11\r\nWhat happens when you share your personal data on our sites or applications?\r\nOther users have access to the information you share on eBay or disclose to other users. For example, other users can see your bids, purchases, items for sale, saved interests, sellers and searches, shopfronts, Feedback, ratings, product reviews and associated comments. Other users can also see any information you choose to share in your profile.\r\n\r\nWhen you use our Services, your public user ID may be displayed and available to the public and associated with all of your public eBay activity. Notices sent to other users about suspicious activity and notice violations on our sites may refer to your public user ID and specific items. Accordingly, if you use a username that allows others to identify you, these others may be able to identify your eBay activities.\r\n\r\nTo help protect your personal data, we allow only limited access to other users' contact, delivery and financial information as necessary to facilitate your transactions and collect payments. However, when users are involved in a transaction, they have access to each other's name, user ID, (alias) email address and other contact and delivery information. For example, we may allow users to exchange telephone numbers in order to contact each other prior to completing a transaction (e.g. a seller may opt to share their telephone number with a buyer so that the buyer may call with questions about a listed item). In this case, sellers are prohibited from using a buyer's telephone number for other purposes (e.g. completing a transaction off eBay or adding the buyer to a marketing list).\r\n\r\nYour responsibilities over transactional information you receive through eBay\r\nWhen you complete a transaction with another user (or a transaction has been cancelled, failed, or subsequently invalidated), we will provide you with the other user's personal data (such as name, username, (alias) email address, contact information, delivery and billing information, or return address). Independent from us, you are the controller of such data and responsible for any processing that you perform after we have shared this data with you, including compliance with any limitations imposed by this User Privacy Notice and our User Agreement.\r\n\r\nUnless you act for purely personal purposes, we recommend that you explain your data processing activities in your own privacy notice and protect the privacy of other users. As a seller, you must in any case comply with the applicable data protection laws and in particular protect the rights of other users as data subjects, e.g. give them the opportunity to access the personal data collected by you and demand that it be erased.\r\n\r\nYou may only use the personal data that you have access to for eBay transaction-related purposes, or for other Services offered through eBay (such as delivery, fraud complaints, and member-to-member communications), and for purposes expressly consented by the user to whom the data relates. Using personal data of other users that you have access to for any other purpose, such as adding them to a mailing list without their express consent, constitutes a violation of our User Agreement.\r\n\r\nPersonal data relating to third parties\r\nIf you provide us with personal data relating to another person, you must obtain the consent of this person or the disclosure of the data to us must be otherwise legally permissible. You must inform the other person of how we process personal data in accordance with our User Privacy Notice.\r\n\r\nFiltering of messages sent via our messaging tools\r\nAll messages sent via our messaging tools (including chat messages and emails sent to eBay alias email addresses) are first received by us and then forwarded to the recipient. All messages are automatically filtered according to certain criteria. If necessary, conspicuous messages are checked manually by our customer service. In the event of a violation of our User Agreement (including any of our rules and policies), we reserve the right to block the transmission of the message and to restrict the purchase and sales functions of your eBay account or to block your eBay account.\r\n\r\nThis is to protect our legitimate interests such as protecting against fraudulent or suspicious activities (e.g. spam, viruses, phishing, or other illegal activities) or enforcing our User Agreement and our other rules and policies (e.g. illegal and other prohibited content), including but not limited to enforcing the prohibition of purchases and sales outside of eBay.\r\n\r\nAre you obliged to provide your personal data to us?\r\nSome of the personal data that you provide to us (e.g. data by which we can identify you) are required to enter into the User Agreement and the Payments Terms of Use. For example, under the Payments Terms of Use you must provide us with certain identification information including legal name, date of birth, and tax identification number or social security number so that we may fulfil our legal \"Know Your Customer\" (KYC) obligations. As described in our User Privacy Notice and in the Payments Terms of Use, we may share this data with other eBay Affiliates in order to facilitate transactions and with service providers, including payment processors, credit agencies and bureaus. Although the provision of any other personal data (e.g. address and delivery data) is voluntary, it may be necessary for the use of our Services, such as bidding, purchase and sales data to complete a transaction.\r\n\r\nChildren's Privacy\r\nOur services are not intended for the use by children. We do not knowingly collect personal data from users who are considered children under applicable national laws. Under our User Agreement, children are not permitted to use our Services.\r\n\r\nStaying Signed in\r\nWhen you sign into your account on our Services, we give you the option to stay signed into your account for a certain amount of time. If you are using a public or shared computer, we encourage you to decline. You or any other user of the computer/browser you signed in on will be able to view and access most parts of your account and take certain specific actions during this signed in period without any further authorisation. The specific actions and account activities that you or any other user of this computer/browser may take include:\r\n\r\nBid, buy or make an offer on an item\r\nCheck out or add items to your cart\r\nPurchase an item with PayPal using Faster Checkout (if enabled in your account)\r\nView the activity header\r\nView the My eBay page\r\nView or edit the Watch List or order details\r\nView the profile page\r\nSend member-to-member messages\r\nConduct after-sale activities, like leaving Feedback, cancelling orders, requesting returns or submitting claims\r\nIf you attempt to change your password or user ID, update any other account information or attempt other account activity beyond those listed above, you may be required to enter your password.\r\n\r\nYou can typically end your signed in session by either signing out and/or clearing your cookies. If you have certain browser privacy settings enabled, simply closing your browser may also end your signed in session. If you are using a public or shared computer, you should sign out and/or clear your cookies when you are done using our Services to protect your account and your personal data.\r\n\r\n \r\n12. Regional and State Privacy Disclosures\r\nFor additional regional disclosures for residents of certain U.S. states, including California, please review our State Privacy Disclosures page. For U.S. sellers (including those in California, Nevada, North Dakota, and Vermont), please follow the link to eBay Commerce Inc.'s U.S. Consumer Privacy Notice. For additional disclosures for specific regions or countries, including Brazil and mainland of People's Republic of China, please review our Regional Privacy Disclosures page.\r\n\r\n \r\n"
