Some online content may remain accessible publicly even after Adobe fulfils a request to delete the poster\u2019s personal information.\n \nPlease be careful when you share your personal information. Do not share anything you wouldn\u2019t want publicly known unless you are sure you are posting it within an app or website that allows you to control who sees what you post. Please note that when you post messages on certain user forums on our websites and app, your email address or name and/or profile photo may be included and displayed with your message. You can find more information about managing your public profile here. To remove content you have shared on our Services and Software, please use the same feature you used to share the content.

If you have questions or concerns about this, please contact us.\n \nIs my personal information secure?\nWe work hard to protect your personal information.

Where Adobe Ireland transfers your personal information to a country which is not within the EEA and is not subject to an adequacy decision by the EU Commission, we rely on one or more of the following legal mechanisms: European Commission approved Standard Contractual Clauses and/or your consent in certain circumstances. A copy of the relevant mechanism can be provided for your review upon request, using the contact details provided at the end of this Privacy Policy. For more information about how Adobe Ireland transfers European personal information, please see Cross-border data transfers.\n \nAdobe and its U.S. subsidiaries Marketo Inc, Magento (X-commerce, Inc) and Workfront Inc. comply with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Adobe has also certified to the US Department of Commerce that it adheres to EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and from the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) in reliance on the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF (as does its U.S. subsidiaries Marketo Inc, Magento (X-commerce, Inc) and Workfront Inc.). Adobe has also certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF (as does its U.S. subsidiaries Marketo Inc, Magento (X-commerce, Inc) and Workfront Inc.). If there is any conflict between the terms in this policy and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern. Adobe\u2019s commitments under the Data Privacy Framework are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the United States Federal Trade Commission. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework programme and to view our certification, please visit https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/.\n\nAs set out above Adobe uses a limited number of third-party service providers to assist us in providing our services to our users and business customers. These third parties may access, process or store personal data in the course of providing their services. Adobe maintains contracts with these third parties restricting their access, use and disclosure of personal data in compliance with our Data Privacy Framework obligations, including the onward transfer provisions and Adobe remains liable if they fail to meet those obligations and Adobe is responsible for the event giving rise to the damage).\n \nThe information above applies to Adobe users who are consumers. More information is available for our business customers that want to learn more about Cross-border data transfers.\n \nWhat rights have I got regarding my personal information and how can I exercise these rights?\nWhen provided for by applicable law, you have the right to ask us for a copy of your personal information; to correct, delete or restrict (stop any active) processing of your personal information; and to obtain the personal information you provide to us for a contract or with your consent in a structured, machine readable format and to ask us to share (port) this information to another controller. You may be entitled to additional rights based on applicable data privacy laws in your jurisdiction.\n \nIn addition, you can object to the processing of your personal information in some circumstances (such as where we are using the information for direct marketing).\n \nThese rights may be limited, for example, if fulfilling your request would reveal personal information about another person or if you ask us to delete information which we are required by law to keep or which we need to defend claims against us. In addition, Adobe websites recognise the Global Privacy Control available in some web browsers. If your browser is configured to send this signal, Adobe will opt you out of Adobe\u2019s use of advertising cookies on that browser. You can learn more about Adobe\u2019s advertising practices and your privacy choices here. \n \nTo exercise any of these rights (including deactivating your Adobe ID account), you can get in touch with us - or our data protection officer - using the details set out below. Additionally, many of our Services and Software allow you to edit your personal information by accessing the \"my account,\" \"my profile,\" or a similar feature of the service you are using. Likewise, you can delete files or photos you have stored in our Services and Software by logging in and using the deletion functions that are available.\n \nIf you have unresolved concerns, you have the right to report them to your local privacy regulator or data protection authority and, where applicable, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with Adobe Ireland's lead supervisory authority, the Irish Data Protection Commission.\n \nWhen you are asked to provide personal information, you may decline. And you may use web browser or operating system controls to prevent certain types of automatic data collection. But if you choose not to provide or allow information that is necessary for certain services or features, those services or features may not be available or fully functional. For example, to register with Adobe, to create an Adobe ID and to use some Adobe Services and Software, the provision of some information is mandatory: if relevant information is not provided, then we will not be able to administer an Adobe account to you or provide you with the Services and Software requested. Other optional information, if not provided, may affect our ability to provide a personalised experience or tailored content or offerings.\n \nWhat rights have I got in my state?\nIn addition to the rights above, see Additional US State Privacy Rights for more information.\n \nWithdrawing consent or otherwise objecting to direct marketing\nThe Adobe family of companies (see list of Adobe entities and our acquired companies) and companies we hire to help market our Services and Software on our behalf may use your information to provide you with information and offers related to Adobe. \n \nWhere we rely on your consent, you will always be able to withdraw that consent, although we may have other legal grounds for processing your information for other purposes, such as those set out above. In some cases, we are able to send you direct marketing without your consent, where we rely on our legitimate interests. You have an absolute right to opt-out of direct marketing or profiling we carry out for direct marketing, at any time by:\n \nupdating your preferences in your Adobe ID profile;\nupdating your preferences in your specific website or app accounts;\nclicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of our marketing emails; or\ncontacting us using the details provided at the end of this privacy policy.\n \nClick here for further information on your choices regarding our marketing practices.\n \nWhat information is collected by companies using Adobe Experience Cloud solutions?\nAdobe Experience Cloud solutions help our business customers personalise and improve the performance of their websites, apps and marketing messages. For example, these customers may use Adobe Experience Cloud solutions to collect and analyse information about how individuals use their websites (learn more). The information collected is stored in our services on behalf of and for use by these business customers.\n \nHow long does Adobe retain my information?\nWhen you register for an account and create an Adobe ID, we process and keep most personal information we process on your behalf for as long as you are an active user of our Services and Software. We delete certain personal information we collect about you when we no longer have a business reason to retain it. Additionally, there is some personal information we need to retain even after you close your account to comply with business and legal requirements, such as personal information related to our contract and business transactions with you, which we retain for ten years after your last interaction with us.\n \nWhere we process personal information for marketing purposes or with your consent, we process the information until you ask us to stop and for a short period after this (to allow us to implement your requests). We also keep a permanent record of the fact that you have asked us not to send you direct marketing or to process your information so that we can respect your request in the future.\n \nCan children use Adobe websites and apps?\n\nAdobe Services and Software are not intended for minors under the age of 13, except in limited situations where certain Creative and Document Cloud applications may be available to children for educational purposes under the direct supervision of a teacher or parent.\n \nFor more information about the collection and use of this and other student data (for students over the age of 13) please see the Adobe & Student Privacy page for more details.\n \nAdditionally, Adobe makes available a Privacy for Younger Users page to provide information for younger users of Adobe\u2019s Services and Software (who are over 13 years of age) in an age appropriate format.\n \nAll other Adobe Services and Software are not intended for use by children and certain Services and Software specifically prohibit users who are under a certain age. If you do not meet applicable age requirements, please do not use those Services and Software.\n \nWill this privacy policy change?\nOccasionally, we may update this privacy policy (or other documents in the Adobe Privacy Centre) to allow Adobe to accommodate new technologies, industry practices, regulatory requirements or for other purposes. If we do, we will change the \"last updated\" date at the top of this policy and the revised policy will be posted to this page so that you are aware of the information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we may disclose it. We encourage you to periodically review the Adobe Privacy Centre for the latest information on our privacy practices. Under certain circumstances (for example with certain material changes or where it is required by applicable privacy laws) we will provide notice to you of these changes and, where required by applicable law, we will obtain your consent. Notice may be by email to you, by posting a notice of such changes on our Services and Software or by other means consistent with applicable law.\n \nWho can I contact with questions or concerns?\nIf you have a privacy question, concern or request, please fill in a privacy enquiry form. \n \nIf you are outside North America, you can also get in touch with Adobe Ireland's data protection officer at DPO@Adobe.com or by postal mail at 4-6 Riverwalk, Citywest Business Park, Dublin 24, Ireland.\n \nFor practices that are covered by our PRP Certification, if you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request.\n \nIf you believe Adobe maintains your personal data in one of the services within the scope of our Data Privacy Framework certification, you may direct any enquiries or complaints concerning our Data Privacy Framework compliance by filling in our privacy enquiry form.
