(Burgerweeshuispad 301, 1076 HR Amsterdam, The Netherlands) and Uber Technologies Inc. (1515 3rd Street, San Francisco, CA, 94158, USA) are the data controllers for the data collected in connection with use of Uber\u2019s services in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom and Switzerland.\r\n\r\nIn addition, for drivers in the UK, (1) the Uber entity holding the relevant private hire vehicle operator license is the data controller for the data required to comply with licensing requirements; and (2) Uber B.V., Uber Technologies, and the Uber entity with whom the driver has entered into a contract, are joint controllers for the data required to comply with worker rights.\r\n\r\nUber Technologies Inc. is the data controller for the data collected in connection with use of Uber\u2019s services everywhere else.\r\n\r\nUber operates, and processes personal data, globally; wherever and whenever you travel, your data travels with you so we can offer you a seamless experience. We also respect your data protection rights whether you are in your home country or elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThis means that we may transfer personal data to countries other than your home country in order to provide our services in a different country at your request. We may also transfer personal data to another country if that is necessary to respond to a customer support request that you submitted outside your region. And trip/order histories may be accessed by users in another country after they have left the country where services were rendered. Because our services involve multiple users at the same time, limited personal data may be accessible to the other user in another country.\r\n\r\nWe do so in order to fulfill our agreements with all of our users, or based on users\u2019 instructions or prior consent, adequacy decisions for the relevant countries, or other transfer mechanisms as may be available under applicable law, such as the Standard Contractual Clauses.\r\n\r\nWe may also transfer data to other countries in order to respond to a request for personal data from a law enforcement agency. To provide additional safeguards to these data transfers, Uber applies a robust internal procedure for processing these requests. Uber only discloses personal data to law enforcement agencies in a manner that is consistent with the regulatory requirements of applicable laws, such as the GDPR. You can find more information about requests from law enforcement here.\r\n\r\nTo help provide equivalent data protection wherever you use our services, Uber has implemented the following measures across the globe:\r\n\r\npolicies and procedures to limit access to, and the processing of personal data for defined purposes;\r\nspecific training of personnel responsible for managing personal data;\r\na government data access policy that refuses government access to data, except when disclosure is mandated by applicable laws including the EU GDPR, there is imminent risk of serious harm to individuals, or consent is obtained;\r\nrobust protection of data while it is in transit between Uber apps and our servers, and when the data is processed on our servers. This includes encryption and the use of pseudonymized data to help protect users' full identity against unauthorized disclosure.\r\nFor your convenience, the exercise of your data protection rights can be directed to Uber via any of the designated channels mentioned above, and will be handled centrally on behalf of the relevant controller. Questions, comments, and complaints about Uber\u2019s data practices can be submitted here. You may also use this form to submit a question to Uber\u2019s Data Protection Officer and to ask us for a copy of the Standard Contractual Clauses or other transfer mechanisms in place for the data processing activity of your inquiry.\r\n\r\nIII.

Data provided by users. This includes:\r\n\r\nUser profile information: We collect data when users create or update their Uber accounts, or place orders via guest checkout features. This may include their name, email, phone number, login name and password, address, profile picture, payment or banking information (including related payment verification information), driver\u2019s license and other government issued documents (which may include identification numbers as well as birth date, gender, and photo). This also includes vehicle or insurance information of drivers and delivery persons, emergency contact information, user settings, and evidence of health or fitness to provide services using Uber apps. \r\nBackground check information (drivers and delivery persons): This includes information submitted during the driver/delivery person application process, such as driver history or criminal record (where permitted by law), license status, known aliases, prior addresses, and right to work. This information may be collected by an authorized vendor on Uber\u2019s behalf.\r\nIdentity verification photos: This includes photos of users (such as, selfies) and/or their government issued identifications (such as, driver\u2019s license or passports). Such photos may be used to verify a user\u2019s identity, such as through facial verification technologies. Please see the section titled \u201cHow we use personal data\u201d for more information regarding how user photos are used for safety and security purposes, including identity verification.\r\nDemographic data: We may collect demographic data about users, such as birth date/age, gender or occupation, when required for certain Uber services or programs, such as Uber Cash, alcohol deliveries or safety features that allow women users to set a preference to provide or receive services to/from other women (\u201cWomen Rider Preference\u201d). We may also collect demographic data, such as age group and household composition, through user surveys, and use this information to offer Uber products and services that are likely to be of interest to you.\r\n\r\nWe may also infer demographic data from other data collected from users. For example, we may infer a user\u2019s gender based on their first name to enable safety features, such as the Women Rider Preference, or to display personalized ads for third party products or services. See the section titled \u201cHow we use personal data\u201d below for more information.\r\nUser content: We collect the data submitted by users when they contact Uber customer support (including at Uber Greenlight Hubs or via phone chat or video conferencing tools), provide ratings or feedback for other users, restaurants or merchants, or otherwise contact Uber. This may include photographs, or audio or video recordings submitted by users in connection with a customer support request. This also includes metadata relating to the method you use to communicate with Uber. The contents of photos and recordings submitted by users are subject to Uber\u2019s Community Guidelines (except that such guidelines do not apply to users in Switzerland and Belgium).\r\n\r\nIn certain jurisdictions, users can record the audio and/or video of their trips through an in-app feature or using a dashcam. In app recordings are encrypted and stored on users\u2019 devices, and are only shared with Uber if submitted by the users in connection with safety incidents. Please see here for more information.\r\nTravel information: We collect travel itinerary information, including times and dates of upcoming flight, lodging or car rental reservations, from users of our Uber Travel feature. We collect such information: (i) when users manually input their information into their Uber Travel itinerary; or (2) if authorized by users to access their email account, from travel-related email confirmations. If so authorized, Uber will only access users\u2019 email accounts to collect travel itinerary information to enable the Uber Travel feature, and will adhere to the applicable email provider policies, including Google\u2019s API Services User Data Policy, which impose certain limitations on the use of data collected from users\u2019 email accounts. Users may remove Uber\u2019s access to their email accounts at any time either in-app or through their email service provider settings. Detailed information on how to remove email account access is available here.\r\n2. Data created during use of our services. This includes: \r\n\r\nLocation data (driver and delivery person): We collect precise or approximate location data from drivers\u2019 and delivery persons\u2019 mobile devices when the Uber app is running in the foreground (app open and on-screen) or background (app open but not on-screen).\r\nLocation data (riders and order recipients). We collect precise or approximate location information from riders\u2019 and order recipients\u2019 mobile devices if they enable us to do so via their device settings.\r\n\r\nUber collects such data from the time a ride or order is requested until it is finished, and any time the app is running in the foreground (app open and on-screen). See \u201cChoice and transparency\u201d below for information on how riders and order recipients can enable precise location data collection.\r\n\r\nRiders and order recipients may use the Uber apps without enabling collection of location data from their mobile devices. However, this may affect certain features in the Uber apps. For example, a rider who has not enabled precise location data will have to manually enter their pickup address.\r\n\r\nIn addition, precise location data collected from a driver\u2019s device during a trip is linked to the rider\u2019s account, even if the rider has not enabled precise location data to be collected from their device. This data is used for purposes such as receipt generation, customer support, fraud detection, insurance, and litigation.\r\nTransaction information: We collect transaction information related to the use of our services, including the type of services requested or provided; trip or order details (such as date and time, requested pick-up and drop off addresses, distance traveled and items ordered); and payment transaction information (such as a restaurant\u2019s or merchant's name and location, amount charged, and payment method). We also associate a user\u2019s name with that of anyone who uses their promotion code.\r\nUsage data: We collect data about how users interact with our services. This includes access dates and times, app features or pages viewed, browser type, and app crashes and other system activity.\r\nDevice data: We collect data about the devices used to access our services, including the hardware models, device IP address or other unique device identifiers, operating systems and versions, software, preferred languages, advertising identifiers, device motion data, and mobile network data.\r\nCommunications data: We collect data regarding phone, text or in-app communications between users that are enabled through Uber\u2019s apps.

Safety and security. We use data to help maintain the safety, security, and integrity of our services and users. This includes:\r\n\r\nverifying users' identity and eligibility to provide transportation or deliveries, including through reviews of background checks, to help prevent use of our services by unsafe drivers and/or riders.\r\n\r\nIn certain regions, this includes Uber\u2019s Real-Time ID Check feature, which prompts drivers and delivery persons to share a selfie before going online to help ensure that the driver or delivery person using the app matches the Uber account we have on file. We may also use this feature for other verification purposes such as verifying change of bank account information or regaining account access.\r\n\r\nIn addition, we may use facial recognition technology to process user profile photographs, identification photographs, or other user-submitted photographs to prevent identity-borrowing or use of our services by unauthorized drivers or delivery people.\r\n\r\nWe may also use selfies to verify that users are wearing masks, helmets or other safety gear through the use of object verification technology.\r\n\r\nIn some countries, riders may be required to verify their identity to use cash and certain other payment methods. In such cases, Uber allows riders to provide their ID number and/or a photo of their identification card to complete such verifications. Please see here for more information about rider identity verification.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, order recipients may be required to provide their age and an image of their government issued identification to verify their eligibility to order and receive alcohol deliveries. Please see here for more information about order recipient identity verification.\r\nusing data from drivers\u2019 or delivery persons\u2019 devices to detect unsafe driving behavior such as speeding or harsh braking and acceleration, and to inform them of safer driving practices. We also use data from delivery persons\u2019 devices to verify the type of vehicles they used to provide deliveries.\r\nusing driver location information, and communications between riders and drivers, to identify cancellation fees earned or induced through fraud. For example, if we determine that a driver is delaying a rider pickup in order to induce a cancellation, we will not charge the rider a cancellation fee and will adjust the amounts paid to the driver to omit such a fee. To object to such an adjustment, please contact Uber customer support.\r\nusing device, location, user profile, usage, and other data to prevent, detect, and combat other types of fraud. This includes identifying fraudulent accounts or uses of our services, preventing use of our services by unauthorized drivers or delivery persons, verifying user identities in connection with certain payment methods, and preventing and combating unauthorized access to users\u2019 accounts. In some cases, such as when a user is determined to be abusing Uber\u2019s referral program or has submitted fraudulent documents, such behavior may result in automatic deactivation, or in the European Union or where otherwise required by law, deactivation after human review. To object to such a deactivation, please contact Uber customer support.\r\nusing user ratings, reported incidents, and other feedback to encourage compliance with our Community Guidelines and as grounds for deactivating users with low ratings or who otherwise violated such guidelines in certain countries. (This data use is not performed in Switzerland and Belgium). In the European Union or where otherwise required by law, such deactivation occurs only after human review and/or the possibility to appeal. For more information about how ratings are determined and used, please see here for rider ratings, here for driver ratings, and here for delivery person ratings. To object to such a deactivation, please contact Uber customer support.\r\nusing driver data (such as past trip information and reported incident rates) and rider data (such as past trip information, cancellation and reported incident rates, account information, ratings information, and current pick-up and drop-off location) to predict and help avoid pairings of users that may result in increased risk of conflict (for instance, because one user previously gave the other a one-star rating).\r\nsharing user name, location, phone number, vehicle details and other relevant information with third-party companies that support the management and de-escalation of interpersonal conflicts that may occur between users while on a trip or in the process of making a delivery.\r\n\r\nUber performs the above activities on the grounds that they are necessary to fulfill the terms of our agreements with users, and/or for purposes of the legitimate safety and security interests of Uber, our users and members of the general public.\r\n3.

This is applicable in all regions except the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom and Switzerland.\r\n5.

With consent\r\n\r\nUber may share a user\u2019s data other than as described in this notice if we notify the user and they consent to the sharing.\r\n\r\nE. Data retention and deletion\r\nUber retains user data for as long as necessary for the purposes described above, including to provide its services and comply with legal obligations.\r\n\r\nUber retains user data for as long as necessary for the purposes described above. The period for which we retain user data is determined by the type of data, the category of user to whom the data relates, and the purposes for which we collected the data.\r\n\r\nThe length for which Uber retains user data may further be determined by legal and regulatory requirements, purposes of safety, security, and fraud prevention, or by issues relating to the user\u2019s account such as an outstanding credit or an unresolved claim or dispute.\r\n\r\nFor example, we retain data:\r\n\r\nfor the life of users\u2019 accounts if such data is necessary to provide our services. E.g., user profile information and credentials.\r\nfor 7 years if necessary to comply with tax requirements. E.g., drivers\u2019 and delivery persons\u2019 trip or delivery location information.\r\nfor defined periods as necessary for purposes of safety or fraud prevention. E.g., we retain incomplete driver applications for 1 year, and rejected driver applications for 7 years.\r\nafter requests for account deletion if necessary for purposes of safety, security, fraud prevention or compliance with legal requirements, or because of issues relating to the user\u2019s account (such as an outstanding credit or an unresolved claim or dispute).\r\nUsers may request deletion of their accounts at any time. Uber may retain user data after a deletion request due to legal or regulatory requirements or for reasons stated in this policy.\r\n\r\n\r\nUsers may request deletion of their account at any time through the Settings > Privacy menus in the Uber app, or through Uber\u2019s website (riders and order recipients here; drivers and delivery persons here; guest checkout users here).\r\n\r\nFollowing an account deletion request, Uber deletes the user\u2019s account and data, unless they must be retained due to legal or regulatory requirements, for purposes of safety, security, and fraud prevention, or because of an issue relating to the user\u2019s account such as an outstanding credit or an unresolved claim or dispute. Because we are subject to legal and regulatory requirements relating to drivers and delivery persons, this generally means that we retain their account and data for the applicable statutory retention period after a deletion request. For riders and order recipients, their data is generally deleted within 90 days of a deletion request, except where retention is necessary for the above reasons.\r\n\r\nIV. Choice and transparency\r\nUber enables users to access and/or control data that Uber collects, including through: \r\n\r\nprivacy settings\r\ndevice permissions\r\nin-app ratings pages\r\nmarketing choices \r\nUber also enables users to request access to or copies of their data, make changes or updates to their accounts, request deletion of their accounts, or request that Uber restrict its processing of user data.\r\n\r\nA.

Please check the available settings on your device or check with your provider.\r\n\r\nC. In-app ratings pages\r\n\r\nAfter every trip, drivers and riders are able to rate each other on a scale from 1 to 5. An average of those ratings is associated with a user\u2019s account and is displayed to other users for whom they provide or receive services. For example, rider ratings are available to drivers from whom they request transportation, and driver ratings are available to their riders.\r\n\r\nThis 2-way system holds everyone accountable for their behavior. Accountability helps create a respectful, safe environment for drivers and riders.\r\n\r\nRiders can see their average rating in the main menu of the Uber app, and also access a breakdown of their average rating in Uber\u2019s Privacy Center.\r\n\r\nDrivers can see their average rating after tapping their profile photo in the Uber Driver app. Click here for more information.\r\n\r\nDelivery persons may also be rated by order recipients, restaurants and merchants.
