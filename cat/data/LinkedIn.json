Data We Collect\r\n1.1 Data You Provide To Us\r\nYou provide data to create an account with us.\r\n\r\nRegistration\r\nTo create an account you need to provide data including your name, email address and/or mobile number, and a password. If you register for a premium Service, you will need to provide payment (e.g., credit card) and billing information.\r\n\r\nYou create your LinkedIn profile (a complete profile helps you get the most from our Services).\r\n\r\nProfile\r\nYou have choices about the information on your profile, such as your education, work experience, skills, photo, city or area and endorsements. You don\u2019t have to provide additional information on your profile; however, profile information helps you to get more from our Services, including helping recruiters and business opportunities find you. It\u2019s your choice whether to include sensitive information on your profile and to make that sensitive information public. Please do not post or add personal data to your profile that you would not want to be publicly available.\r\n\r\nYou give other data to us, such as by syncing your address book or calendar.\r\n\r\nPosting and Uploading\r\nWe collect personal data from you when you provide, post or upload it to our Services, such as when you fill out a form, (e.g., with demographic data or salary), respond to a survey, or submit a resume or fill out a job application on our Services. If you opt to import your address book, we receive your contacts (including contact information your service provider(s) or app automatically added to your address book when you communicated with addresses or numbers not already in your list).\r\n\r\nIf you sync your contacts or calendars with our Services, we will collect your address book and calendar meeting information to keep growing your network by suggesting connections for you and others, and by providing information about events, e.g. times, places, attendees and contacts.\r\n\r\nYou don\u2019t have to post or upload personal data; though if you don\u2019t, it may limit your ability to grow and engage with your network over our Services.\r\n\r\n1.2 Data From Others\r\nOthers may post or write about you.\r\n\r\nContent and News\r\nYou and others may post content that includes information about you (as part of articles, posts, comments, videos) on our Services. We also may collect public information about you, such as professional-related news and accomplishments, and make it available as part of our Services, including, as permitted by your settings, in notifications to others of mentions in the news.\r\n\r\nOthers may sync their contacts or calendar with our Services\r\n\r\nContact and Calendar Information\r\nWe receive personal data (including contact information) about you when others import or sync their contacts or calendar with our Services, associate their contacts with Member profiles, scan and upload business cards, or send messages using our Services (including invites or connection requests). If you or others opt-in to sync email accounts with our Services, we will also collect \u201cemail header\u201d information that we can associate with Member profiles.\r\n\r\nCustomers and partners may provide data to us.\r\n\r\nPartners\r\nWe receive personal data (e.g., your job title and work email address) about you when you use the services of our customers and partners, such as employers or prospective employers and applicant tracking systems providing us job application data.\r\n\r\nRelated Companies and Other Services\r\nWe receive data about you when you use some of the other services provided by us or our affiliates, including Microsoft. For example, you may choose to send us information about your contacts in Microsoft apps and services, such as Outlook, for improved professional networking activities on our Services\r\n\r\n1.3 Service Use\r\nWe log your visits and use of our Services, including mobile apps.\r\n\r\nWe log usage data when you visit or otherwise use our Services, including our sites, app and platform technology, such as when you view or click on content (e.g., learning video) or ads (on or off our sites and apps), perform a search, install or update one of our mobile apps, share articles or apply for jobs. We use log-ins, cookies, device information and internet protocol (\u201cIP\u201d) addresses to identify you and log your use.\r\n\r\n1.4 Cookies and Similar Technologies\r\nWe collect data through cookies and similar technologies.\r\n\r\nAs further described in our Cookie Policy, we use cookies and similar technologies (e.g., pixels and ad tags) to collect data (e.g., device IDs) to recognize you and your device(s) on, off and across different services and devices where you have engaged with our Services. We also allow some others to use cookies as described in our Cookie Policy. If you are outside the Designated Countries, we also collect (or rely on others who collect) information about your device where you have not engaged with our Services (e.g., ad ID, IP address, operating system and browser information) so we can provide our Members with relevant ads and better understand their effectiveness. Learn more. You can opt out from our use of data from cookies and similar technologies that track your behavior on the sites of others for ad targeting and other ad-related purposes. For Visitors, the controls are here.\r\n\r\n1.5 Your Device and Location\r\nWe receive data through cookies and similar technologies\r\n\r\nWhen you visit or leave our Services (including some plugins and our cookies or similar technology on the sites of others), we receive the URL of both the site you came from and the one you go to and the time of your visit. We also get information about your network and device (e.g., IP address, proxy server, operating system, web browser and add-ons, device identifier and features, cookie IDs and/or ISP, or your mobile carrier). If you use our Services from a mobile device, that device will send us data about your location based on your phone settings. We will ask you to opt-in before we use GPS or other tools to identify your precise location.\r\n\r\n1.6 Messages\r\nIf you communicate through our Services, we learn about that.\r\n\r\nWe collect information about you when you send, receive, or engage with messages in connection with our Services. For example, if you get a LinkedIn connection request, we track whether you have acted on it and will send you reminders. We also use automatic scanning technology on messages to support and protect our site. For example, we use this technology to suggest possible responses to messages and to manage or block content that violates our User Agreement or Professional Community Policies from our Services.\r\n\r\n1.7 Workplace and School Provided Information\r\nWhen your organization (e.g., employer or school) buys a premium Service for you to use, they give us data about you.\r\n\r\nOthers buying our Services for your use, such as your employer or your school, provide us with personal data about you and your eligibility to use the Services that they purchase for use by their workers, students or alumni. For example, we will get contact information for \u201cCompany Page\u201d administrators and for authorizing users of our premium Services, such as our recruiting, sales or learning products.\r\n\r\n1.8 Sites and Services of Others\r\nWe get data when you visit sites that include our ads, cookies or some of our plugins or when you log-in to others\u2019 services with your LinkedIn account.\r\n\r\nWe receive information about your visits and interaction with services provided by others when you log-in with LinkedIn or visit others\u2019 services that include some of our plugins (such as \u201cApply with LinkedIn\u201d) or our ads, cookies or similar technologies.\r\n\r\n1.9 Other\r\nWe are improving our Services, which means we get new data and create new ways to use data.\r\n\r\nOur Services are dynamic, and we often introduce new features, which may require the collection of new information. If we collect materially different personal data or materially change how we collect, use or share your data, we will notify you and may also modify this Privacy Policy.\r\n\r\nKey Terms \r\n2. How We Use Your Data\r\nWe use your data to provide, support, personalize and develop our Services.\r\n\r\nHow we use your personal data will depend on which Services you use, how you use those Services and the choices you make in your settings. We use the data that we have about you to provide and personalize our Services, including with the help of automated systems and inferences we make, so that our Services (including ads) can be more relevant and useful to you and others.\r\n\r\n2.1 Services\r\nOur Services help you connect with others, find and be found for work and business opportunities, stay informed, get training and be more productive.\r\n\r\nWe use your data to authorize access to our Services and honor your settings.\r\n\r\nStay Connected\r\nOur Services allow you to stay in touch and up to date with colleagues, partners, clients, and other professional contacts. To do so, you can \u201cconnect\u201d with the professionals who you choose, and who also wish to \u201cconnect\u201d with you. Subject to your and their settings, when you connect with other Members, you will be able to search each others\u2019 connections in order to exchange professional opportunities.\r\n\r\nWe use data about you (such as your profile, profiles you have viewed or data provided through address book uploads or partner integrations) to help others find your profile, suggest connections for you and others (e.g. Members who share your contacts or job experiences) and enable you to invite others to become a Member and connect with you. You can also opt-in to allow us to use your precise location or proximity to others for certain tasks (e.g. to suggest other nearby Members for you to connect with, calculate the commute to a new job, or notify your connections that you are at a professional event).\r\n\r\nIt is your choice whether to invite someone to our Services, send a connection request, or allow another Member to become your connection. When you invite someone to connect with you, your invitation will include your network and basic profile information (e.g., name, profile photo, job title, region). We will send invitation reminders to the person you invited. You can choose whether or not to share your own list of connections with your connections.\r\n\r\nVisitors have choices about how we use their data.\r\n\r\nStay Informed\r\nOur Services allow you to stay informed about news, events and ideas regarding professional topics you care about, and from professionals you respect. Our Services also allow you to improve your professional skills, or learn new ones. We use the data we have about you (e.g., data you provide, data we collect from your engagement with our Services and inferences we make from the data we have about you), to personalize our Services for you, such as by recommending or ranking relevant content and conversations on our Services. We also use the data we have about you to suggest skills you could add to your profile and skills that you might need to pursue your next opportunity. So, if you let us know that you are interested in a new skill (e.g., by watching a learning video), we will use this information to personalize content in your feed, suggest that you follow certain members on our site, or suggest related learning content to help you towards that new skill. We use your content, activity and other data, including your name and photo, to provide notices to your network and others. For example, subject to your settings, we may notify others that you have updated your profile, posted content, took a social action, used a feature, made new connections or were mentioned in the news.\r\n\r\nCareer\r\nOur Services allow you to explore careers, evaluate educational opportunities, and seek out, and be found for, career opportunities. Your profile can be found by those looking to hire (for a job or a specific task) or be hired by you. We will use your data to recommend jobs or mentees, show you and others relevant professional contacts (e.g., who work at a company, in an industry, function or location or have certain skills and connections). You can signal that you are interested in changing jobs and share information with recruiters. We will use your data to recommend jobs to you and you to recruiters. We may use automated systems to provide content and recommendations to help make our Services more relevant to our Members, Visitors and customers. Keeping your profile accurate and up-to-date may help you better connect to others and to opportunities through our Services.\r\n\r\nProductivity\r\nOur Services allow you to collaborate with colleagues, search for potential clients, customers, partners and others to do business with. Our Services allow you to communicate with other Members and schedule and prepare meetings with them. If your settings allow, we scan messages to provide \u201cbots\u201d or similar tools that facilitate tasks such as scheduling meetings, drafting responses, summarizing messages or recommending next steps. Learn more.\r\n\r\n2.2 Premium Services\r\nOur premium Services help paying users to search for and contact Members through our Services, such as searching for and contacting job candidates, sales leads and co-workers, manage talent and promote content through social\r\n\r\nWe sell premium Services that provide our customers and subscribers with customized-search functionality and tools (including messaging and activity alerts) as part of our talent, marketing and sales solutions. Customers can export limited information from your profile, such as name, headline, current company, current title, and general location (e.g., Dublin), such as to manage sales leads or talent, unless you opt-out. We do not provide contact information to customers as part of these premium Services without your consent. Premium Services customers can store information they have about you in our premium Services, such as a resume or contact information or sales history. The data stored about you by these customers is subject to the policies of those customers. Other enterprise Services and features that use your data include TeamLink and Elevate (social promotion of content).\r\n\r\n2.3 Communications\r\nWe contact you and enable communications between Members. We offer settings to control what messages you receive and how often you receive some types of messages.\r\n\r\nWe will contact you through email, mobile phone, notices posted on our websites or apps, messages to your LinkedIn inbox, and other ways through our Services, including text messages and push notifications. We will send you messages about the availability of our Services, security, or other service-related issues. We also send messages about how to use our Services, network updates, reminders, job suggestions and promotional messages from us and our partners. You may change your communication preferences at any time. Please be aware that you cannot opt out of receiving service messages from us, including security and legal notices.\r\n\r\nWe also enable communications between you and others through our Services, including for example invitations, InMail, groups and messages between connections.\r\n\r\n2.4 Advertising\r\nWe serve you tailored ads both on and off our Services. We offer you choices regarding personalized ads, but you cannot opt-out of seeing other ads.\r\n\r\nWe target (and measure the performance of) ads to Members, Visitors and others both on and off our Services directly or through a variety of partners, using the following data, whether separately or combined:\r\n\r\nData from advertising technologies on and off our Services, pixels, ad tags, cookies, and device identifiers;\r\nMember-provided information (e.g., profile, contact information, title and industry);\r\nData from your use of our Services (e.g., search history, feed, content you read, who you follow or is following you, connections, groups participation, page visits, videos you watch, clicking on an ad, etc.), including as described in Section 1.3;\r\nInformation from advertising partners, vendors and publishers ; and\r\nInformation inferred from data described above (e.g., using job titles from a profile to infer industry, seniority, and compensation bracket; using graduation dates to infer age or using first names or pronoun usage to infer gender; using your feed activity to infer your interests; or using device data to recognize you as a Member).\r\nWe will show you ads called sponsored content which look similar to non-sponsored content, except that they are labeled as advertising (e.g., as \u201cad\u201d or \u201csponsored\u201d). If you take a social action (such as like, comment or share) on these ads, your action is associated with your name and viewable by others, including the advertiser. Subject to your settings, if you take a social action on the LinkedIn Services, that action may be mentioned with related ads. For example, when you like a company we may include your name and photo when their sponsored content is shown.\r\n\r\nAd Choices\r\nWe adhere to self-regulatory principles for interest-based advertising and participate in industry opt-outs from such ads. This does not opt you out of receiving advertising; you will continue to get other ads by advertisers not listed with these self regulatory tools. You can also opt-out specifically from our uses of certain categories of data to show you more relevant ads. For Visitors, the setting is here.\r\n\r\nInfo to Ad Providers\r\nWe do not share your personal data with any third-party advertisers or ad networks except for: (i) hashed IDs or device identifiers (to the extent they are personal data in some countries); (ii) with your separate permission (e.g., in a lead generation form) or (iii) data already visible to any users of the Services (e.g., profile). However, if you view or click on an ad on or off our Services, the ad provider will get a signal that someone visited the page that displayed the ad, and they may, through the use of mechanisms such as cookies, determine it is you. Advertising partners can associate personal data collected by the advertiser directly from you with hashed IDs or device identifiers received from us. In such instances, we seek to contractually require such advertising partners to obtain your explicit, opt-in consent before doing so.\r\n\r\n2.5 Marketing\r\nWe promote our Services to you and others.\r\n\r\nIn addition to advertising our Services, we use Members\u2019 data and content for invitations and communications promoting membership and network growth, engagement and our Services, such as by showing your connections that you have used a feature on our Services.\r\n\r\n2.6 Developing Services and Research\r\nWe develop our Services and conduct research\r\n\r\nService Development\r\nWe use data, including public feedback, to conduct research and development for our Services in order to provide you and others with a better, more intuitive and personalized experience, drive membership growth and engagement on our Services, and help connect professionals to each other and to economic opportunity.\r\n\r\nOther Research\r\nWe seek to create economic opportunity for Members of the global workforce and to help them be more productive and successful. We use the personal data available to us to research social, economic and workplace trends, such as jobs availability and skills needed for these jobs and policies that help bridge the gap in various industries and geographic areas. In some cases, we work with trusted third parties to perform this research, under controls that are designed to protect your privacy. We publish or allow others to publish economic insights, presented as aggregated data rather than personal data.\r\n\r\nSurveys\r\nPolls and surveys are conducted by us and others through our Services. You are not obligated to respond to polls or surveys, and you have choices about the information you provide. You may opt-out of survey invitations.\r\n\r\n2.7 Customer Support\r\nWe use data to help you and fix problems.\r\n\r\nWe use data (which can include your communications) to investigate, respond to and resolve complaints and for Service issues (e.g., bugs).\r\n\r\n2.8 Insights That Do Not Identify You\r\nWe use data to generate insights that do not identify you.\r\n\r\nWe use your data to produce and share insights that do not identify you. For example, we may use your data to generate statistics about our members, their profession or industry, to calculate ad impressions served or clicked on, or to publish visitor demographics for a Service or create demographic workforce insights.\r\n\r\n2.9 Security and Investigations\r\nWe use data for security, fraud prevention and investigations.\r\n\r\nWe use your data (including your communications) for security purposes or to prevent or investigate possible fraud or other violations of our User Agreement and/or attempts to harm our Members, Visitors or others.\r\n\r\nKey Terms \r\n3. How We Share Information\r\n3.1 Our Services\r\nAny data that you include on your profile and any content you post or social action (e.g., likes, follows, comments, shares) you take on our Services will be seen by others, consistent with your settings.\r\n\r\nProfile\r\nYour profile is fully visible to all Members and customers of our Services. Subject to your settings, it can also be visible to others on or off of our Services (e.g., Visitors to our Services or users of third- party search engines). As detailed in our Help Center, your settings, degree of connection with the viewing Member, the subscriptions they may have, their usage of our Services, access channels and search types (e.g., by name or by keyword) impact the availability of your profile and whether they can view certain fields in your profile.\r\n\r\nPosts, Likes, Follows, Comments, Messages\r\nOur Services allow viewing and sharing information including through posts, likes, follows and comments.\r\n\r\nWhen you share an article or a post (e.g., an update, image, video or article) publicly it can be viewed by everyone and re-shared anywhere (subject to your settings). Members, Visitors and others will be able to find and see your publicly-shared content, including your name (and photo if you have provided one).\r\nIn a group, posts are visible to others in the group. Your membership in groups is public and part of your profile, but you can change visibility in your settings.\r\nAny information you share through companies\u2019 or other organizations\u2019 pages on our Services will be viewable by it and others who visit those pages.\r\nWhen you follow a person or organization, you are visible to others and that \u201cpage owner\u201d as a follower.\r\nWe let senders know when you act on their message, subject to your settings where applicable.\r\nSubject to your settings, we let a Member know when you view their profile.\r\nWhen you like or re-share or comment on another\u2019s content (including ads), others will be able to view these \u201csocial actions\u201d and associate it with you (e.g., your name, profile and photo if you provided it).\r\nYour employer can see how you use Services they provided for your work (e.g. as a recruiter or sales agent) and related information. We will not show them your job searches or personal messages.\r\n\r\nEnterprise Accounts\r\nYour employer may offer you access to our enterprise Services such as Recruiter, Sales Navigator, LinkedIn Learning or our advertising Campaign Manager. Your employer can review and manage your use of such enterprise Services.\r\n\r\nDepending on the enterprise Service, before you use such Service, we will ask for permission to share with your employer relevant data from your profile or use of our non-enterprise Services. For example, users of Sales Navigator will be asked to share their \u201csocial selling index\u201d, a score calculated in part based on their personal account activity. We understand that certain activities such as job hunting and personal messages are sensitive, and so we do not share those with your employer unless you choose to share it with them through our Services (for example, by applying for a new position in the same company or mentioning your job hunting in a message to a co-worker through our Services).\r\n\r\nSubject to your settings, when you use workplace tools and services (e.g., interactive employee directory tools) certain of your data may also be made available to your employer or be connected with information we receive from your employer to enable these tools and services.\r\n\r\n3.2 Communication Archival\r\nRegulated Members may need to store communications outside of our Service.\r\n\r\nSome Members (or their employers) need, for legal or professional compliance, to archive their communications and social media activity, and will use services of others to provide these archival services. We enable archiving of messages by and to those Members outside of our Services. For example, a financial advisor needs to archive communications with her clients through our Services in order to maintain her professional financial advisor license.\r\n\r\n3.3 Others\u2019 Services\r\nYou may link your account with others\u2019 services so that they can look up your contacts\u2019 profiles, post your shares on such platforms, or enable you to start conversations with your connections on such platforms. Excerpts from your profile will also appear on the services of others.\r\nSubject to your settings, other services may look up your profile. When you opt to link your account with other services, personal data will become available to them. The sharing and use of that personal data will be described in, or linked to, a consent screen when you opt to link the accounts. For example, you may link your Twitter or WeChat account to share content from our Services into these other services, or your email provider may give you the option to upload your LinkedIn contacts into its own service. Third-party services have their own privacy policies, and you may be giving them permission to use your data in ways we would not. You may revoke the link with such accounts.\r\n\r\nSubject to your settings, excerpts from your profile will appear on the services of others (e.g., search engine results, mail and calendar applications that show a user limited profile data of the person they are meeting or messaging, social media aggregators, talent and lead managers). \u201cOld\u201d profile information remains on these services until they update their data cache with changes you made to your profile.\r\n\r\n3.4 Related Services\r\nWe share your data across our different Services and LinkedIn affiliated entities.\r\n\r\nWe will share your personal data with our affiliates to provide and develop our Services. We may combine information internally across the different Services covered by this Privacy Policy to help our Services be more relevant and useful to you and others. For example, we may personalize your feed or job recommendations based on your learning history.\r\n\r\n3.5 Service Providers\r\nWe may use others to help us with our Services.\r\n\r\nWe use others to help us provide our Services (e.g., maintenance, analysis, audit, payments, fraud detection, marketing and development). They will have access to your information as reasonably necessary to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes.\r\n\r\n3.6 Legal Disclosures\r\nWe may need to share your data when we believe it\u2019s required by law or to help protect the rights and safety of you, us or others.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that we will need to disclose information about you when required by law, subpoena, or other legal process or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) investigate, prevent or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (2) enforce our agreements with you; (3) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations; (4) protect the security or integrity of our Services (such as by sharing with companies facing similar threats); or (5) exercise or protect the rights and safety of LinkedIn, our Members, personnel or others. We attempt to notify Members about legal demands for their personal data when appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. We may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but we do not promise to challenge every demand. To learn more see our Data Request Guidelines and Transparency Report.\r\n\r\n3.7 Change in Control or Sale\r\nWe may share your data when our business is sold to others, but it must continue to be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\r\n\r\nWe can also share your personal data as part of a sale, merger or change in control, or in preparation for any of these events. Any other entity which buys us or part of our business will have the right to continue to use your data, but only in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy unless you agree otherwise.\r\n\r\n4. Your Choices & Obligations\r\n4.1 Data Retention\r\nWe keep most of your personal data for as long as your account is open.\r\n\r\nWe generally retain your personal data as long as you keep your account open or as needed to provide you Services. This includes data you or others provided to us and data generated or inferred from your use of our Services. Even if you only use our Services when looking for a new job every few years, we will retain your information and keep your profile open, unless you close your account. In some cases we choose to retain certain information (e.g., insights about Services use) in a depersonalized or aggregated form.\r\n\r\n4.2 Rights to Access and Control Your Personal Data\r\nYou can access or delete your personal data.
