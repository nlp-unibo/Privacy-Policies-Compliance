See here for information on data subject rights requests and how to submit a request.\r\n\r\n7.1 Access and Portability.

You have the right to ask us to delete your personal information, subject to certain limitations and restrictions. Please note that if you request the erasure of your personal information:\r\n\r\n    7.3.1 Legitimate Business Interests. We may retain personal information as necessary for our legitimate business interests, such as prevention of money laundering, fraud detection and prevention, and enhancing safety.

We may retain and use your personal information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal, tax, reporting, and auditing obligations.\r\n    7.3.3 Shared Information.

If we are processing your personal information based on your consent you can withdraw your consent at any time by changing your account settings or by sending a communication to Airbnb specifying which consent you are withdrawing.

RETENTION. We retain personal information for as long as needed or as permitted in light of the purpose(s) for which it was obtained and consistent with applicable law. The criteria used to determine our retention periods include:\r\n\r\n    - the length of time we have an ongoing relationship with you, whether you are a Guest or a Host, and provide Airbnb to you (for example, for as long as you have an account with us or keep using Airbnb),\r\n    - whether there is a legal obligation to which we are subject (for example, certain laws, such as anti-money laundering requirements) require us to keep records of your transactions for a certain period of time before we can delete them); and/or\r\n    - whether retention is advisable in light of our legal position or to protect the safety of individuals (such as in regard to applicable statutes of limitations, litigation, or regulatory investigations).\r\n\r\n9. OPERATING GLOBALLY. \r\n\r\n9.1 International Transfers. To facilitate our global operations, Airbnb and Airbnb Payments may transfer, store, and process your information within our family of companies, partners, and service providers based in Europe, Asia Pacific and North and South America. Laws in these countries may differ from the laws applicable to your country of residence. In certain circumstances, courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies, or security authorities in these other countries may be entitled to access your personal information. Some of these countries are subject to a European Commission adequacy decision, such as Japan, New Zealand, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Israel. For other countries, measures have been taken pursuant to applicable data protection law, such as standard contractual clauses within Airbnb or with the relevant third party to protect this personal data.\r\n\r\n9.2 Other Means to Ensure an Adequate Level of Data Protection. If Airbnb Ireland is the Controller and your information is shared with corporate affiliates or third-party service providers outside the EEA, we have (prior to sharing your information with such corporate affiliates or third-party service providers) established the necessary means to ensure an adequate level of data protection. This may be an adequacy decision of the European Commission confirming an adequate level of data protection in the respective non-EEA country or an agreement on the basis of the EU Model Clauses (a set of clauses issued by the European Commission). We will provide further information on the means to ensure an adequate level of data protection, such as a copy of the EU Model Clauses, on request.\r\n\r\nSchedule 1:\r\n\r\nYOUR PLACE OF RESIDENCE OR ESTABLISHMENT / YOUR ACTIVITY ON THE AIRBNB PLATFORM / YOUR CONTROLLER / CONTACT ADDRESS\r\n______________________________________\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAustralia\r\n______________________________________\r\n\r\nPayments Services in connection with booking any Host Service.\r\n\r\nAirbnb Payments Australia Pty.
