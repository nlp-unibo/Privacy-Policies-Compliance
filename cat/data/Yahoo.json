        "plainText": "Welcome to the Yahoo Privacy Policy\r\nLast updated: July 2023\r\n\r\nAbout Yahoo\r\nYahoo, previously known as Verizon Media, is a technology and media company that provides a range of services. We serve our consumers, partners, advertisers and talent through our portfolio of digital platforms, products and services offered under our AOL, Yahoo and other brands.\r\n\r\nWe provide control tools to help you manage your experience with us. If you have an existing Yahoo or AOL account, you will need to agree to this Privacy Policy. If you have not yet agreed to this Privacy Policy, the legacy Yahoo Privacy Policy or legacy Oath Privacy Policy (for AOL) still apply to your account. For Yahoo products or services that are accessed without signing in to an account, this Privacy Policy applies to those products and services as of May 25, 2018. If you are creating a new account, the terms below apply starting today.\r\n\r\nExcept as set out elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, when we refer to \u2018Yahoo\u2019, it means Yahoo Inc., the US-established company that supplies the Services to you (and acts as data controller of the personal data Yahoo collects when you use those Services).\r\nOur Privacy Pledge\r\nOur commitment is to put users first. We strive to be transparent about how we collect and use your information, to keep your information secure and to provide you meaningful choices.\r\n\r\nThis Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what information Yahoo, its affiliates and its house of global brands (\u201cYahoo,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d \u201cour\u201d or \u201cwe\u201d) collect, why we collect it and what we do with it. This policy applies to Yahoo brands, websites, apps, advertising services, products, services or technologies (we\u2019ll collectively refer to these as \u201cServices\u201d). Additional privacy practices for certain Services can be found in Details for Specific Products and Services.\r\n\r\nYour Controls\r\nWe believe you should have tools to control your information. You can find controls to manage or review your account information, marketing preferences, location data, and search history at Privacy Controls. Some of our Services provide additional controls and privacy practices. (See, Details for Specific Products and Services)\r\n\r\nInformation Collection and Use - General\r\nCertain categories of information collected by Yahoo are necessary to use our Services, such as the information you must provide when registering for some Services. We may collect and combine information when you interact with Yahoo Services information outlined below:\r\n\r\nInformation You Provide to Us. We may collect the information that you provide to us, such as:\r\n\r\nWhen you create an account with a Yahoo Service or brand. (Please note, when you use our Services, we may recognize you or your devices even if you are not signed in to our Services.) Yahoo may use device IDs, cookies, and other signals, including information obtained from third parties, to associate accounts and/or devices with you.\r\n\r\nWhen you use our Services to communicate with others or post, upload or store content (such as comments, photos, voice inputs, videos, emails, messaging services and attachments).\r\n\r\nYahoo analyzes and stores all communications content, including email content from incoming and outgoing mail. This allows us to deliver, personalize and develop relevant features, content, advertising and Services.\r\n\r\nWhen you otherwise use our Services, such as title queries, watch history, page views, search queries, view the content we make available or install any Yahoo software such as plugins.\r\n\r\nWhen you sign up for paid Services, use Services that require your financial information or complete transactions with us or our business partners, we may collect your payment and billing information.\r\n\r\nDevice Information. We collect information from your devices (computers, mobile phones, tablets, etc.), including information about how you interact with our Services and those of our third-party partners and information that allows us to recognize and associate your activity across devices and Services. This information includes device specific identifiers and information such as IP address, cookie information, mobile device and advertising identifiers, browser version, operating system type and version, mobile network information, device settings, and software data. We may recognize your devices to provide you with personalized experiences and advertising across the devices you use. \r\n\r\nLocation Information. We collect location information from a variety of sources. You can learn more about and manage your location permissions on our Locations page and by visiting the location settings tool on your devices.\r\n\r\nInformation from Cookies and Other Technologies.\r\n\r\nWe collect information when you access content, advertising, sites, interactive widgets, applications, and other products (both on and off of our Services) where Yahoo data collection technologies (such as web beacons, development tools, cookies and other technologies, etc.) are present. These data collection technologies allow us to understand your activity on and off our Services and to collect and store information when you interact with Services we offer to partners.\r\n\r\nThis information also includes the kind of content or ads served, viewed or clicked on; the frequency and duration of your activities; the sites or apps you used before accessing our Services and where you went next; whether you engaged with specific content or ads; and whether you went on to visit an advertiser's website, downloaded an advertiser\u2019s app, purchased a product or service advertised, or took other actions. \r\n\r\nInformation from Others. We collect information about you when we receive it from other users, third-parties, and affiliates, such as: \r\n\r\nWhen you connect your account to third-party services or sign in using a third-party partner (like Facebook or Twitter).\r\n\r\nFrom publicly-available sources.\r\n\r\nFrom advertisers about your experiences or interactions with their offerings.\r\n\r\nWhen we obtain information from third-parties or other companies, such as those that use our Services. This may include your activity on other sites and apps as well as information those third-parties provide to you or us. \r\n\r\nHow We Use This Information\r\nWe are able to deliver, personalize, and improve our Services by combining and using the information we have about you (including information we receive on and off our Services) to understand how you use and interact with our Services and the people or things you\u2019re connected to and interested in. We also may use the information we have about you for the following purposes: \r\n\r\nProvide, maintain, improve, and develop relevant features, content, and Services.\r\n\r\nAnalyze your content and other information (including emails, instant messages, posts photos, attachments, and other communications). You can review and control certain types of information tied to your Yahoo account by using Privacy Controls. \r\n\r\nFulfill your requests and when authorized by you. \r\n\r\nHelp advertisers and publishers connect to offer relevant advertising in their apps and websites.\r\n\r\nMatch and serve targeted advertising (across devices and both on and off of our Services) and provide targeted advertising based on your device activity, inferred interests and location information.\r\n\r\nContact you with information about your account or with marketing messages, which you can also control. \r\n\r\nAssociate your activity across our Services and your different devices as well as associate any accounts you may use across Yahoo Services together. We may associate activity and accounts under a single user ID. \r\n\r\nCarry out or support promotions.\r\n\r\nConduct research and support innovation. \r\n\r\nCreate analytics and reports for external parties, including partners, publishers, advertisers, apps, third-parties and the public regarding the use of and trends within our Services and ads, including showing trends to partners regarding general preferences, the effectiveness of ads and information on user experiences. These analytics and reports may include aggregate or pseudonymized information.\r\n\r\nProvide location-based Services, advertising, search results, and other content consistent with your location settings.\r\n\r\nCombine information we have about you with information we obtain from business partners or other companies, such as your activities on other sites and apps.\r\n\r\nDetect and defend against fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful activity.\r\n\r\nWe provide you with controls to manage your experience with us. For example, you can review or edit your account information, manage your marketing preferences, or opt out of targeted ads. If you opt out, you will continue to see ads, but they may not be as relevant or useful to you. \r\n\r\nIf you are located in the European Union or European Economic Area or in the UK (EU/EEA/UK), please see Section 10 \u201cOur Legal Bases for Processing Information\u201d for more information that applies to your use of our Services.\r\nHow We Share This Information\r\nYahoo shares information within its affiliated brands and companies. We also share information we have about you for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, including to provide Services that you have requested (including when you connect with third-party apps and widgets). We do not sell, license or share information that individually identifies our customers with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Yahoo unless one of the following circumstances applies:\r\n\r\nWith Your Consent. We will share information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Yahoo when we have your consent. \r\n\r\nWithin Yahoo.

We may share aggregated or pseudonymous information (including demographic information) with partners, such as publishers, advertisers, measurement analytics, apps, or other companies. For example, we may tell an advertiser how its ads performed or report how many people installed an app after seeing a promotion. We do not share personally identifiable information (like phone number or email address) with these partners, such as publishers, advertisers, ad agencies, or analytics partners.\r\n\r\nWhen you use third-party apps, websites or other products integrated with our Services, they may collect information about your activities subject to their own terms and privacy policies. \r\n\r\nWe allow other companies that show advertisements on our webpages or apps to collect information from your browsers or devices.

We may access, preserve and disclose information to investigate, prevent, or take action in connection with: (i) legal process and legal requests; (ii) enforcement of the Terms; (iii) claims that any content violates the rights of third-parties; (iv) requests for customer service; (v) technical issues; (vi) protecting the rights, property or personal safety of Yahoo, its users or the public; (vii) establishing or exercising our legal rights or defending against legal claims; or (viii) as otherwise required by law.\r\n\r\nThis may include responding to lawful governmental requests. Learn more about how we evaluate and respond to these requests. \r\n\r\nNew Ownership. If the ownership or control of all or part of Yahoo or a specific Services changes as a result of a merger, acquisition or sale of assets, we may transfer your information to the new owner. \r\n\r\nDetails for Specific Products and Services\r\nAdditional privacy practices for certain Yahoo Services are included here.\r\n\r\nInformation Security and Data Retention\r\nYahoo has technical, administrative and physical safeguards in place to help protect against unauthorized access, use or disclosure of customer information we collect or store. \r\n\r\nYahoo will retain your personal information for as long as necessary to provide the applicable Yahoo Services to you. In some cases, Yahoo has certain business or legal requirements that result in an obligation to retain your personal information for an extended period of time. These obligations may include financial record keeping, ensuring continuity of our products or services, security, fraud, and abuse prevention, or compliance with our legal obligations. In some limited cases, we may keep data for longer than needed for the purposes set out in the Yahoo Privacy Dashboard, such as: (i) replicating or backing up certain data to \u201coffline\u201d storage for disaster recovery purposes; (ii) truncating, redacting or summarizing raw data, log files and database records into statistical aggregate data or probabilistic data structures to understand long term trends; (iii) maintaining de-identified data for varying periods for research, reporting and product testing or development (in these cases, unique identifiers and linkages to existing data about you are broken or removed so that this data is no longer associated with you, your browser, or device); or (iv) keeping and using certain data to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes or enforce our agreements (for example, we might keep data associated with an account subject to litigation or a request from law enforcement). For specific information about your personal information or how your personal information is processed by a particular Yahoo product or service you may interact with, please log into the Yahoo Privacy Dashboard.\r\n\r\nProtecting Children\u2019s Privacy\r\nOur Services are for a general audience. We do not knowingly collect, use, or share information that could reasonably be used to identify children under age 13 without prior parental consent or consistent with applicable law. With parental permission, a child under age 13 might have a Yahoo Family Account. Visit Children's Privacy & Family Accounts to learn more about children\u2019s privacy at Yahoo.\r\n\r\nOur Legal Bases for Processing Information. We mainly rely on three separate bases to lawfully process your information. First, we need to process your information in certain ways to provide our services to you, in accordance with our Terms of Service. This processing is necessary to perform the contract between you and us. Second, where you have given us consent to use your information in certain ways, we will rely on your consent. Third, in certain cases, we may process your information where necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of third parties, where those legitimate interests are not overridden by your rights or interests. Occasionally, Yahoo may rely on other legal bases to process your information, such as to protect a user\u2019s vital interests (such as where there is a risk of imminent harm) or to comply with a legal obligation. Please see our Legal bases page for more information.\r\n\r\nData Processing and Transfers\r\n\r\nWhen you use or interact with any of our Services, you consent to the data processing, sharing, transferring and uses of your information as outlined in this Privacy Policy. Regardless of the country where you reside, you authorize us to transfer, process, store and use your information in countries other than your own in accordance with this Privacy Policy and to provide you with Services. Some of these countries may not have the same data protection safeguards as the country where you reside. \r\n\r\nYahoo processes information related to individuals in the EU/EEA/UK and transfers that information from the EU/EEA/UK through various compliance mechanisms, including data processing agreements based on the European Commission\u2019sA Standard Contractual Clauses. By using our Services, you consent to us transferring information about you to these countries. For more information, please visit our Data Transfer page.\r\n\r\nThe United States and other non-EU/EEA/UK countries have different laws on data protection and rules in relation to government access to information. If you are based in the EU/EEA/UK, when your data is moved from your home country to a third country outside the EU/EEA/UK, some of these countries may not have the same data protection safeguards as your home country.\r\n\r\nOther Important Information\r\nThis Privacy Policy Applies Only to Yahoo. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Yahoo does not own or control, or to people that Yahoo does not employ or manage. In addition, some affiliated products may have different privacy policies and practices that are not subject to this Privacy Policy. \r\n\r\nChanges\r\nWe may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, so you should check it periodically. If we make changes that are material we will provide you with appropriate notice before such changes take effect.\r\n\r\nQuestions & Suggestions\r\nIf you have questions, suggestions, or wish to make a complaint, please complete a feedback form or you can contact us at:\r\n\r\nYahoo\r\nCustomer Care - Privacy Policy Issues\r\n770 Broadway, New York\r\nNY 10003, USA\r\n\r\nIf you wish to contact our Data Protection Officer, you can do so by post to: Attn: Data Protection Officer, Yahoo EMEA, 5-7 Point Square, North Wall Quay, Dublin 1, Ireland.\r\n\r\nOur Article 27 Representative can be contacted by email at YahooGDPRrepresentative@mhc.ie, or by post at:\r\n\r\nMHC GDPR Representative\r\nMason Hayes and Curran Professional Services Limited\r\nSouth Bank House\r\nBarrow Street\r\nDublin 4\r\nIreland\r\n\r\nRecent Versions\r\n\r\nMay 2018 - update to privacy notice;\r\n\r\nOctober 2019 - Oath to Verizon Media name change;\r\n\r\nOctober 2020 - updates to data transfers and legal bases; and\r\n\r\nSeptember 2021 - updates to reflect name change; additional information added regarding data retention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUPPLEMENTARY TEXT FROM EXTERNAL PAGES LINKED IN THE PRIVACY POLICY\r\n\r\n\r\nLegal Bases\r\n\r\nWe rely on different legal bases to lawfully process your data in connection with our products and services.
