        "plainText": "MyHeritage Privacy Policy\r\nThis Privacy Policy was last updated on June 21, 2023.\r\nIf you have not reviewed it since that date, please do so now.\r\nPRIVACY POLICY SUMMARY\r\nWho Are We?\r\n\r\nMyHeritage is a direct-to-consumer company headquartered in Israel. MyHeritage develops services for family history research and DNA testing.\r\n\r\nOur Key Privacy Principles\r\n\r\nMyHeritage was founded in 2003 and has enjoyed the trust of its users ever since. MyHeritage cares deeply about the privacy of its users and the privacy of their data and its top priority is to honor their trust.\r\n\r\nMyHeritage has never sold or licensed personal data (like customer names, email addresses, residence addresses and family trees) and will never do so in the future.\r\n\r\nMYHERITAGE HAS NEVER SOLD OR LICENSED GENETIC DATA OR HEALTH DATA, AND WILL NEVER DO SO IN THE FUTURE.\r\n\r\nMyHeritage will never provide data to insurance companies under any circumstances. MyHeritage prohibits law enforcement use of its DNA Services.\r\n\r\nUsers can delete their data from MyHeritage at any time. Deletion is permanent and irreversible.\r\n\r\nIf anything material ever changes in this privacy policy, we will notify you by email.\r\n\r\nCapitalized terms used but not defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning ascribed to them in our Terms and Conditions.\r\n\r\nWhat Information Do We Collect About You?\r\n\r\nWe collect the information that we need to provide our Service (as defined in our Terms and Conditions), as described below:\r\n\r\nInformation you share directly with us. For example, information that you enter when you sign up for the Service, create a family tree or do your family history research using the Service, communicate with our customer support staff and our automated virtual assistant, fill in a questionnaire or survey on our Website, and so on.\r\n\r\nInformation from Public and Historical Records. We digitize such records ourselves or license them from archives and other sources, to create content needed by genealogists. These records may include public information about you.\r\n\r\nInformation from our DNA Services. If you purchase our DNA test or upload your DNA data to our Website, we extract your DNA from your DNA sample or use your uploaded DNA Results, process them and conduct genetic analysis in order to provide you with our DNA Services. DNA Services are not available in Russia, Israel, and a number of other countries.\r\n\r\nInformation from our Photo Tagger feature. If you choose to use our Photo Tagger feature, it identifies faces in your photos and creates facial recognition models (i.e., biometric information). The Photo Tagger clusters faces of the same person appearing in multiple photos, and lets you tag them in all photos in one go.\r\n\r\nInformation we receive when you use our Service. We collect web-behavior information using automated means of data collection technologies (like cookies) to enhance your experience of visiting the Website and understand how our Services are being used. See our Cookie Policy for more information.\r\n\r\nHow Do We Use Your Personal Information?\r\n\r\nTo provide our Service to you. This includes displaying your family tree, comparing your family tree to other family trees to serve you Smart Matches\u2122, comparing your family tree to historical records to serve you Record Matches, comparing your DNA data to other users to serve you DNA Matches, providing you with DNA Reports, and so on.\r\n\r\nTo communicate with you about the Service.\r\n\r\nTo market the Service to you, from which you can opt-out at any time.\r\n\r\nFor internal business purposes, to improve and develop new products and services, perform internal data analysis, analyze the use of the Website to improve the customer experience or assess our promotional campaigns.\r\n\r\nFor internal research, with your consent. If you voluntarily choose to participate in our research and agree to our DNA Informed Consent.\r\n\r\nWill MyHeritage Disclose any of Your Personal Information to Third Parties?\r\n\r\nPERSONAL INFORMATION PROVIDED BY YOU, INCLUDING GENETIC INFORMATION AND HEALTH INFORMATION, WILL NEVER BE SOLD OR LICENSED BY US TO THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING INSURANCE COMPANIES, GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, OTHER CORPORATIONS OR EMPLOYERS.\r\n\r\nWe will not provide information to law enforcement unless we are required by a valid court order or subpoena for genetic information.\r\n\r\nWe will not disclose any of your personal information to any third party except in the following very limited circumstances:\r\n(a) with our service providers (e.g., payment platforms) under the protection of appropriate agreements \u2013 to provide you with our Service; (b) with your DNA Matches (if enabled) and with your Smart Matches (if enabled); (c) when required of us by law or during legal proceedings, or to prevent fraud and cybercrime; (d) for research, if you explicitly consented to the DNA Informed Consent; and (e) in connection with the acquisition of our business.\r\n\r\nSecurity of Your Personal Information\r\n\r\nWe have implemented technical, physical and administrative security measures to protect against the loss, misuse, unauthorized access, alteration or disclosure of users' personal information under our control. For example: we periodically review and enhance our security and privacy practices as necessary, we commission periodic penetration tests to test the robustness of the security of our Service, only authorized personnel have access to personal information, and we only work with labs and third parties who meet and commit to our security standards.\r\n\r\nManaging Your Privacy\r\n\r\nWe give you the ability to share information in a variety of ways. You can choose when and with whom you share your information outside of the Service. You can disable DNA Matching or Smart Matching\u2122, opt out of viewing results for certain incurable conditions within the DNA Health Reports, give or decline consent for research, manage cookies using your browser controls, request to destroy your DNA sample/s, and delete your account and data, at any time.\r\n\r\nFULL PRIVACY POLICY\r\nIn this document (the \"Privacy Policy\") we provide information on what personal information is collected and why, as well as how we use the personal information to provide you with a personalized, user-friendly experience on the Website.

If you have questions about our changes, contact us at privacy@myheritage.com.\r\n\r\n2. WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION IS COLLECTED FROM YOU OR ABOUT YOU?\r\nWe collect information we believe is necessary to provide you with the Service. The amount of other personal information you decide to submit to MyHeritage is up to you.\r\n\r\nHere are the types of personal information we request, collect or you provide:\r\n\r\n1) Name, Contact Information and Payment Details: When you sign up for the Service, we ask for your name, gender and email address, as well as birth year and country. The birth year is collected to ensure that you comply with the Terms and Conditions with regards to underage and minor users. If you purchase a subscription or another product, we will need to know your postal address, phone number and payment details to facilitate payment and fulfillment.\r\n\r\n2) Information on Your Family and Others: You may also enter additional personal information about yourself and others in the course of building your family tree, doing your family research on the Website or otherwise using our Services, e.g., names, relationships, dates and places of birth and death, contact information such as email address, and photos.\r\n\r\nIf you choose to invite a family member or another person to view or edit your family tree, we will ask you for the individual's email address and name. You must first make certain that you have obtained their consent to pass on their details to MyHeritage, before you invite them.\r\n\r\nWhen building a family tree, you decide which relatives to add to the family tree, whether to add deceased relatives, living relatives or both, and which information to include about them. Adding living relatives to the family tree requires you to obtain their prior consent. Before adding living relatives below legal age to the family tree, you must obtain the consent of their parent or guardian.\r\n\r\nIf you choose to add an audio recording to a photo or a profile in your family tree, such recordings will be stored and made available for listening only to you and to members in your family site. You can delete them at any time.\r\n\r\n3) Information from Public and Historical Records: We digitize, license and procure records from various sources, including birth, marriage and death certificates, census records, immigration lists, newspapers and other records. Such records may contain personal information relating to you.\r\n\r\n4) DNA Information: DNA-related information is generated and stored when you use our DNA Services, i.e., when you purchase our DNA test kit, or upload your DNA data that was generated by another DNA testing service. Our DNA Services will extract your DNA from your DNA sample or use your uploaded DNA Results, process them and conduct genetic analysis in order to provide you with our DNA Reports.\r\n\r\n5) Biometric Information: If you choose to use our Photo Tagger feature, it uses facial recognition technology, to create facial recognition models (i.e., biometric information) of you and your deceased relatives, in order to help you tag people in your photos quickly and easily.\r\n\r\n6) Your Comments and Opinions: If you post messages or comments on our blogs or Facebook accounts, or our message boards, we may capture that information.\r\n\r\n7) Your Use of the Service: While you use our Service, we may collect information based on your interaction with our Website or from the devices or computers you use to access the Website, to enhance your experience of visiting the Website and understand how our Services are being used. This may include web log information, \u201cclickstream\u201d data (for example, the type of computer and browser you use, the address of the website from which you linked to the Website), page views and IP addresses.\r\n\r\n8) Your Communications: Your communications with other users through the Service\u2019s features (e.g., MyHeritage Inbox), as well as information you provide us in communications with our customer support team (e.g., support tickets), or other representatives and/or information you provide while interacting and communicating with our automated virtual assistant, will be collected and recorded by us and, with respect to our automated virtual assistant, recorded by our service provider Cognigy.AI.\r\n\r\n9) Your Survey Answers: If you voluntarily participate in any Surveys or questionnaires on the Service, we will collect the information you provide.\r\n\r\n10) Your Health Questionnaire Information: Before providing you with the DNA Health Reports, we collect certain self-reported family health history information from you, about you and your family members using a questionnaire (the \u201cHealth Questionnaire Information\u201d and the \u201cHealth Questionnaire\u201d, respectively). In the USA, we are obligated to collect this information to comply with health regulations. Outside the USA, we are not obligated but we collect it for data consistency.\r\n\r\n11) Third Party Account Authentication Services: You may link an account from Google to your account on our Service, for authentication. This will allow you to use your credentials from the other service to create a MyHeritage account or to sign in to MyHeritage, without having to enter details manually such as your email address. If you choose to do so, we will collect and use the information you authorized to share with us via that service, (for example, the email address for a connected Google account), in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\r\n\r\n12) Information from Integration with Genealogy Partners: Our genealogy partners such as Roots Magic and Family Historian (the \"Genealogy Partners\") may pass genealogical information from family trees of their users to us via an integration for matching with our family trees and records. We do not receive a license to this information sent by Genealogy Partners, it is not collected by us, and it is deleted automatically after matches are calculated.\r\n13) Your Image Data: If you use our photo features such as Deep Nostalgia\u2122, DeepStory, MyHeritage In Color\u2122, MyHeritage Photo Enhancer, AI Time Machine\u2122 and/or Photo Scanner, we will process information obtained from photos you upload (\"Image Data\"), in order to provide the applicable service to you. These photo features do not collect or retain any biometric information or biometric identifiers from your photos. Uploading photos, or any other personal information, of living individuals to our Services, requires you to obtain their prior consent. Before uploading photos or any other personal information of minors or underage children to the Service, you must obtain the consent of their parent or guardian.\r\n\r\n3. HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?\r\n1) To provide the Service to You: We primarily use your personal information to fulfill the purpose(s) for which you have provided the personal information to us. These purpose(s) include displaying your family tree, re-running family history searches you made on MyHeritage to find more records for you, processing your subscription and providing you with customer support. We also use your personal information to serve you Smart Matches\u2122 and Record Matches for your family tree, or to enable you and other members of the MyHeritage community to contact each other, and so on.\r\n\r\nIf you are using our DNA Services: We will process and store your DNA samples, conduct genetic analysis and provide you with the DNA Results and DNA Reports. If DNA Matching is enabled, we will compare your DNA data to other users to serve you DNA Matches. If you are interested in the DNA Health Reports, the Health Questionnaire Information will allow us to determine your eligibility to receive them. For U.S. customers, the DNA Health Reports are provided pursuant to a physician\u2019s order. We may add new DNA Health Reports for you as they become available.\r\n\r\nIf you use our photo features which are based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms, such as Deep Nostalgia\u2122, DeepStory, MyHeritage In Color\u2122, MyHeritage Photo Enhancer, and/or AI Time Machine\u2122, we will process Image Data to animate your photos, colorize them or restore their original colors, enhance them, or create conceptual theme images from your photos.\r\n\r\nIf you use our AI Time Machine\u2122 feature: Photos uploaded to the AI Time Machine\u2122 feature are not shared with any third party. Uploaded photos are not used to train or improve the AI algorithms; they are only used to generate the user's AI images and not for any other purpose. MyHeritage does not keep or store the uploaded photos. They are deleted immediately after an AI Time Machine\u2122 model has been generated. If a model has not been generated successfully, the photos are kept for a maximum period of 24 hours for retries, and are then deleted.\r\n\r\nIf you use our Photo Tagger feature, note that it uses facial recognition technology powered by Amazon. When enabled, this feature identifies faces in your photos and creates facial recognition models. It clusters faces of the same person appearing in multiple photos, and allows you to tag them in all photos in one go. The Photo Tagger learns the appearance of deceased people you tag, and makes tagging suggestions when you upload new photos to MyHeritage. Tagging is never automatic and always requires your confirmation.This feature is not enabled by default and requires your explicit consent to start working and create facial recognition models (i.e., biometric information) of you and your deceased relatives. Facial recognition name tagging suggestions are provided only for individuals known from your family tree to be deceased. Any facial recognition models are used only for the photos in your family site and are never used to create tagging suggestions for photos uploaded by other users who are not members in your family site.\r\nMyHeritage will never sell or license Photo Tagger information to third parties.\r\n\r\nWhen you engage with our automated virtual assistant, we and our service provider Cognigy.AI will process personal information, record your chat communications, and use AI technology to analyze your request, all in order to provide you with a suitable response and to improve your experience. Information that the automated virtual assistant recognizes as being a credit card number (based on the unique pattern of credit card numbers), will not be captured.\r\n\r\n2) To communicate with you: We may communicate with you for the purpose of informing you of updates or additions to the Service, or to seek feedback from you about the Service. Our communications with you will be conducted primarily via email, but may also be made via telephone, direct mail or another method of communication in some circumstances. If you do not want to continue to receive emails from us, you may opt out at any time by using the unsubscribe link listed in the email or by setting your Email Preferences. If you wish to opt out of other methods of communication, please contact us at privacy@myheritage.com.\r\n\r\n3) To market our services: By signing up to the Service, you agree that we may use your contact information as well as information about your use of the Service, to offer you complementary MyHeritage products or services. Such promotional offers may be made via email, telephone or direct mail. We will never send you promotional offers by Text Message (SMS). The only Text Messages (SMS) you may receive from us are messages about upcoming birthdays and wedding anniversaries of close family members in your family if you opted-in to that specific feature.\r\n\r\nIf you do not want to receive marketing offers via email, you may opt out at any time by using the unsubscribe link listed in the email or by setting your Email and Communication Preferences. See the section on Email Preferences below. If you do not want to receive marketing offers via telephone, you can also do that via the Email and Communication Preferences. You can also instruct us to stop communicating with you by contacting us at privacy@myheritage.com or request this whenever you are speaking with any representative of MyHeritage.\r\n\r\nThe aggregated information gathered from you and other users through the Surveys may be used in our marketing, and such emails or promotional offers may be presented to you.\r\n\r\n4) For internal business purposes: In order to improve the Service and to develop new products and services, we may use your personal information for internal data analysis, for studying how the Website is used, to help us diagnose problems and secure the Service, identifying usage trends and determining the effectiveness of promotional campaigns. For example, we may examine how much time visitors spend on each page of the Website and how they navigate through the Website, and use this information to improve the Website.\r\n\r\nWe use your IP address to deliver the Website and our Service to you and to help diagnose problems with our servers. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information such as geographic distribution of our members. When you visit the Service for the first time, we use your IP address to suggest the Service to you in the language deemed most appropriate for the geographical region from which it originates.\r\n\r\n5) To perform research: If you voluntarily agreed to the DNA Informed Consent, we may use your information (such as DNA Results and other DNA information) for the purposes of research as specified therein. Your informed consent may be revoked at any time through the Website. Your identity and the identity of your family members will never be disclosed by us in any publication of any research results. Read our DNA Informed Consent to learn more about the MyHeritage DNA Research Project.\r\n\r\n4. LEGAL GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION\r\nUnder EU data protection law, (\"GDPR\"), and Brazil's data protection law, the Lei Geral de Prote\u00e7\u00e3o de Dados (\"LGPD\"), all processing of personal information is justified by a \"condition\" for processing. In the majority of cases, any processing will be justified on the basis that:\r\n\r\nyou have consented to the processing\r\nthe processing is necessary to perform a contract with you (e.g., processing your payments or creating your user account)\r\nthe processing is necessary to comply with a relevant legal obligation; or\r\nthe processing is in our legitimate interests, subject to your interests and fundamental rights\r\nIn addition, the processing of \"special category data\" or \"sensitive personal data\" is only permitted where a relevant exemption exists. Special category data includes any genetic information, which we process as part of the DNA Services or the MyHeritage DNA Research Project, any information about your ethnic origin or the Health Questionnaire Information, and facial recognition models (i.e., biometric information), which we process if you are using the Photo Tagger feature. In these cases, the special category data or sensitive personal data is processed on the basis of your explicit consent. Where the basis of processing is your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent, and therefore prevent that processing, at any time.\r\n\r\n5. WILL MYHERITAGE DISCLOSE ANY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES?\r\nPERSONAL INFORMATION PROVIDED BY YOU, INCLUDING GENETIC INFORMATION AND HEALTH INFORMATION, WILL NEVER BE SOLD OR LICENSED BY US TO THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING INSURANCE COMPANIES, GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, OTHER CORPORATIONS OR EMPLOYERS.\r\n\r\nThese protections cover everything related to DNA, including DNA samples, DNA Results, DNA Reports, DNA Health Reports, facial recognition models (i.e., biometric information), and so on.\r\n\r\nWe will not provide information to law enforcement unless required by a valid court order or subpoena for genetic information.\r\n\r\nMyHeritage will not disclose any of your personal information to any third party except in the limited circumstances listed below:\r\n\r\n1) With our service providers: We use several reputable third parties to perform various tasks for us, under the protection of appropriate agreements. For example, we use leading third party platforms to process payments from you (mainly Adyen, Stripe, BlueSnap and PayPal), to provide us with cloud storage services (mainly Amazon and Google Cloud), to assist us in marketing and advertising, consumer research analytics, development of new algorithms and services, fraud prevention, security and the processing of customer support requests. We use an automatic tool called Google Dialogflow to semantically analyze incoming customer support tickets in order to classify them according to their intent, for purposes of expediting and optimizing the processing of those tickets. Before any tickets are passed to Dialogflow, we remove identifiable information (such as names and email addresses), and all tickets are deleted from Dialogflow immediately after their intent is classified. For purposes of expediting and optimizing the processing of incoming customer support calls, we use a text-to-speech conversion service by Microsoft Azure, which helps us transcribe the content of incoming support calls. The calls are automatically deleted after conversion to text and are not saved by Microsoft.\r\nOur automated virtual assistant is enabled by Cognigy.AI. Cognigy.AI operates as our service provider and will not use your personal information for any purpose but to provide us with the service and improve it.\r\nIf you choose to use our DeepStory feature, note that we use text-to-speech conversion services provided by Microsoft Azure and Amazon Polly to facilitate the DeepStory feature. The text is promptly deleted after it is converted to a voice file and is not stored by these services.\r\n\r\nWe use Google Customer Reviews to collect feedback about our services. If you approve Google sending you a survey, please note that your email, order delivery date, your country and the content of your review will be processed by Google as a Controller and therefore will be subject to Google\u2019s privacy policy.\r\n\r\nIf you choose to use our Photo Tagger feature, note that it uses facial recognition technology powered by Amazon. This feature is not enabled by default and requires your explicit consent.\r\n\r\nIn the case of DNA Services, we use fulfillment and shipping companies (mainly Jay Group and Ingram) as well as the specialized DNA lab Gene by Gene, located in Texas, USA to process, extract and store DNA samples. These third-parties are only given access to the minimal information needed to perform their auxiliary functions and are prohibited from using it for other purposes.\r\n\r\nFor processing orders for MyHeritage DNA Health Upgrades from customers residing in the United States, we work with an independent network of fully licensed, board certified physicians and genetic counselors, PWNHealth, LLC (www.pwnhealth.com) (\"PWNHealth\"). PWNHealth provides physician oversight and genetic counselling, as required for compliance. For the purpose of PWNHealth's review by a physician and genetic counselor, your personal information, including the Health Questionnaire Information, the DNA Results and the DNA Health Reports will be confidentially shared with PWNHealth.\r\nFor the processing of customer support requests, we utilize, in addition to our own employees, the customer support firm TELUS International Services Limited which operates customer support teams on our behalf in Ireland (as of November 2017) and in Guatemala (as of January 2020).\r\n\r\nWith respect to third-parties outside the European Economic Area, we have taken steps to ensure your personal information is adequately protected, as required by applicable law.\r\n\r\n2) With members of your family site, your Smart Matches\u2122 (if enabled), and your DNA Matches (if enabled):\r\n\r\nInformation you upload to your family site will be available to all members of your family site.\r\n\r\nSmart Matches\u2122 is a technology developed and owned by MyHeritage to find matches between family trees, by looking for individuals that they have in common. Smart Matches\u2122 are very useful in that they facilitate discoveries of unknown relatives and reuniting families whose ties have been disconnected over time. Other MyHeritage users may receive notifications regarding Smart Matches\u2122 between individuals in their family tree and individuals in your family tree. Smart Matches\u2122 may also be found on living individuals in your tree. If you are concerned about the privacy of your family tree, to the extent that you do not wish to allow potential relatives to find and view parts of it, you can disable Smart Matches\u2122 for your family tree(s). By default, Smart Matches\u2122 are enabled. If Smart Matches\u2122 are enabled, users of MyHeritage\u2019s Genealogy Partners may receive Smart Matches with your family tree. Such matches are not bi-directional: you will not receive Smart Matches\u2122 with the users of MyHeritage\u2019s Genealogy Partners. Visit our Help Center to learn more about Smart Matches.\r\n\r\nDNA Matches are a key feature of our DNA Services, across MyHeritage DNA kits and DNA data uploads.\r\nIf you use our DNA Services, when DNA Matches are enabled, your DNA Results will be matched with other users and may be linked to your profile page, and the DNA Genealogy Reports will include a list of your potential relatives, based on DNA. Each one of the people who match your DNA will be able to see the amount of DNA they have in common with you, the predicted family relationship between you, and some of your personal information such as your display name, your country of residence, your ethnicity estimate and genetic groups, and other profile information, depending on your privacy settings (but none of your DNA Matches will be able to see your DNA Health Reports). If a DNA Match is found between you (or any other person of which you are the DNA manager), and another individual whose DNA Results are stored in our database, both you and such individual will be notified of the match, provided, that, both of you have DNA Matching enabled in your privacy settings. DNA Matches may have significant personal implications because they may reveal unexpected family connections. This may expose relationships that are not supported by DNA, or DNA may indicate relationships that contradict existing relationships in your family tree. If you use the DNA Services and are concerned about the implications of DNA Matches, you can disable DNA Matches for your profile and for any other profile of which you are the DNA manager. When DNA Matches are disabled, your DNA will not be matched with other people, no DNA Matches will be found, and any DNA Matches found previously will be deleted. If you are unable or unwilling to contend with the consequences and any possible negative impact of such inferences you should not submit DNA samples and/or DNA Results to us, and you should delete your DNA Results and DNA Reports. Visit our Help Center to learn more about DNA Matches.\r\n\r\n3) In legal or privacy circumstances: if required of us by law or during legal proceedings, or to prevent fraud and cybercrime.\r\n\r\n4) For research: If you explicitly agreed to the DNA Informed Consent, for the research purposes indicated therein, your information may be aggregated and used in research studies published by MyHeritage, always without identifying information such as your name, email address, etc. Personal information provided by you, including genetic information and health information, will never be sold or licensed by us to third parties. Read our DNA Informed Consent to learn more about the MyHeritage DNA Research Project.\r\n\r\n5) In an acquisition of MyHeritage: in the event that MyHeritage, or substantially all of its assets or stock are acquired the processing and transfer of personal information may be needed. Note that this situation is not unique to MyHeritage and applies to most companies.\r\n\r\n6. HOW DO YOU DELETE INFORMATION ABOUT YOURSELF OR YOUR FAMILY, OR REPORT IT TO US?\r\nDeleting your account: See instructions for deleting your account. This will irreversibly delete not only your account and the personal data you\u2019ve entered but also your family sites, family trees, DNA data and health data.\r\n\r\nDeleting your DNA Results and DNA Reports, and Destroying your DNA sample: Your DNA Results and DNA Reports are controlled by you and can be deleted by you at any time by using the delete function from the \"Manage DNA kits\" page on the Website. You can also request our Customer Support to do this for you. We will, if requested by you, destroy the DNA sample provided by you or your DNA sample which was provided to us by another person with your permission, at any time. To request destruction of your DNA sample, contact us at privacy@myheritage.com.\r\n\r\nDeleting your Health Questionnaire Information: you may delete your Health Questionnaire Information by deleting your account or contacting our Customer Support.\r\n\r\nDeleting facial recognition models: All facial recognition models are automatically deleted 3 months after your last use of the Photo Tagger feature. You can delete all facial recognition models at any time by turning off the Photo Tagger feature in your privacy settings, or by turning off the Photo Tagger feature in App Settings > Photos.\r\n\r\nDeleting or amending information that others have posted about you or your family: If the information was posted in a family site where you are a member, you may delete it. Otherwise, if you are not able to delete or amend such information posted by another member, contact us at privacy@myheritage.com.

Non-personal information also includes personal information that has been aggregated in a manner such that the end-product does not personally identify you or any other user of the Website, for example, by using personal information to calculate the percentage of our users from a particular country or who are female. Because non-personal information does not personally identify you, we may use such non-personal information for any purpose. In addition, we reserve the right to share such non-personal information.\r\nSome web browsers and devices permit you to broadcast a preference that you not be \u201ctracked\u201d online. We do not modify your online experience based upon whether such a signal is broadcast.\r\n\r\n8. SECURITY AND TRANSFER OF INFORMATION\r\nWhen you provide us with any personal information, that personal information may be transferred to and stored by us in our secure data centers which may provide a different level of protection for personal information than in your country of residence. By providing us with personal or genetic information, you should be aware that it will be transferred, processed and stored in our data centers, located in the United States. You understand that DNA samples will be stored in the United States as provided in the Terms and Conditions.\r\n\r\nMyHeritage takes appropriate steps to ensure that transfers of personal information are done in accordance with applicable law and carefully managed to protect your privacy rights and interests. Accordingly, transfers are limited to countries which are recognized as providing an adequate level of legal protection or where we can be satisfied that alternative safeguards are in place to protect your privacy rights. In particular, we rely on the EU Commission standard contractual clauses. You have a right to contact us for more information about the safeguards we have put in place.\r\n\r\nYou acknowledge that in the event that you download your DNA Results: 1) such download will create a copy that is not protected by MyHeritage\u2019s security and privacy settings; 2) such download and the storage of your DNA Results after you have downloaded it, shall all be made at your own risk; and 3) MyHeritage will not have any control over the downloaded DNA Results and shall not be liable to you or to any third party in connection with such download and/or storage.\r\n\r\nWe implement and maintain reasonable security, appropriate to the nature of the personal information that we collect, use, retain, transfer or otherwise process. We are committed to developing, implementing, maintaining, monitoring, and updating a reasonable information security program, but no such program can be perfect; in other words, all risks cannot reasonably be eliminated. Data security incidents and breaches can occur due to vulnerabilities, criminal exploits or other factors that cannot reasonably be prevented. Accordingly, while our reasonable security program is designed to manage data security risks and thus help prevent data security incidents and breaches, it cannot be assumed that the occurrence of any given incident or breach results from our failure to implement and maintain reasonable security.\r\n\r\nYou are responsible for keeping your password for the Service confidential. MyHeritage requires you to not share your password with anyone. MyHeritage requires you to not use the same password that you use on MyHeritage on any other service.\r\n\r\nMyHeritage will comply with applicable laws in the event of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your personal information and, where we consider appropriate or where required by applicable law, notify you via email, in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as it is consistent with any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.\r\n\r\n9. DATA RETENTION\r\nWe will retain your personal information only for as long as necessary to fulfil the purpose(s) for which it was collected and to comply with applicable laws. This means that we store your personal information for as long as it is required to deliver our services, except where we have a lawful basis for saving it for an extended period of time (for instance, after your subscription expires, we may still have a legitimate interest in using your contact details for marketing our service to you). We also retain the personal information we need for the execution of pending tasks and to realize our legal rights and our claims, as well as retain certain personal information that we must store for a legally mandatory period of time (in that latter case, the processing of such information by us is limited). If you agreed to the DNA Informed Consent, we may retain the information provided thereunder for as long as we determine required for the research purposes disclosed therein.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, where you or we delete your content, copies of that information may remain viewable elsewhere to the extent any such copy has been shared with others, was otherwise distributed pursuant to your privacy settings, or was copied or stored by other users. For example, a part of your family tree may have been copied by other users into their own family tree. Removed and deleted information may persist in backup copies for a limited time for our internal business purposes, but it will not be available to you or other users.\r\n\r\nDNA Sample Retention\r\n\r\nAll DNA samples are stored at our testing lab in the United States. A DNA sample may be kept by us unless or until circumstances require us to destroy the DNA sample, which you can request at any time by contacting us using the contact details below, or it is no longer suitable for testing purposes. We may store the DNA samples for a period of ten (10) years for additional genetic testing, always subject to obtaining your explicit approval in advance for such additional testing.\r\n\r\nFacial Recognition Models\r\nIf you use our Photo Tagger feature, all facial recognition models are automatically deleted 3 months after your last use of the Photo Tagger feature. In addition, you can delete all facial recognition models at any time.\r\n\r\n10. MANAGING YOUR PRIVACY\r\nYou can control how you share personal information by changing your privacy settings in the following areas:\r\n\r\nEmail Preferences: this allows you to control what marketing emails and other emails we may send you. All non-transactional emails sent to you by MyHeritage have a footer link that leads directly to the Email Preferences page in which you can conveniently turn off any particular email type you do not wish to receive any longer, or re-enable some emails that you have turned off in the past. Family site emails have a link at their footer to the site preferences page which allows you to unsubscribe from or re-subscribe to event reminder emails and family site activity newsletter emails.\r\n\r\nMyHeritage typically refrains from sending commercial offers originating from partners, affiliates and third parties. To the extent that MyHeritage sends an offer, it is most likely about a service owned and operated by MyHeritage or integrated into the Service.\r\n\r\nPrivacy Preferences: this allows you to control the information that others can see about you and your personal information. See extended details about Privacy Preferences.\r\n11. YOUR RIGHTS\r\nYou may revise your personal information by adjusting your account settings. You also have the right to ask MyHeritage to amend any personal information it holds about you if it is inaccurate or misleading as to any matter of fact. MyHeritage has instituted a process for verifying that the person making a request is the customer about whom we have collected information. We may ask you to provide identifying information to compare it to the personal information already maintained by us. We may require a more stringent verification process depending on the sensitivity of the personal information involved. Any request to amend personal Information in MyHeritage's records should be in writing and addressed by email to privacy@myheritage.com.\r\n\r\n12.

CHILDREN\r\nOur Services are not directed or targeted to children under the age of 13, and MyHeritage does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the Minimum Age (for more information, see section \"Underage Users\" in our Terms and Conditions). If MyHeritage learns that a child under the Minimum Age has provided personally identifiable information to the Website, we will use reasonable efforts to remove such information from our files. If you provide information about a child, you, as parent or legal guardian, consent to the processing and use of such information by us in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\r\n\r\n18.
