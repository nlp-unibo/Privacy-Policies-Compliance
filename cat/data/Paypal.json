Specific information about automated decision-making and profiling\r\n\u201cAutomated-decision making\u201d is the process of making a decision by fully automated means without human involvement. In some cases\r\nthese decisions could have a legal or similarly significant eect on you as an individual. \u201cProfiling\u201d means analysis of an individual's\r\npersonality, behaviour, interest and habits to make predictions or decisions about them. Where authorised under UK law or where\r\nnecessary for the entry into or performance of a contract, we may in some cases use automated decision-making or profiling for decisions.\r\nAn example of our use of automated decision making is evaluation of your creditworthiness to assess your suitability for certain credit\r\nproducts.\r\nWe believe that by making such decisions automatically, PayPal increases its objectivity and transparency in deciding which services to\r\noer you. We deploy several safety mechanisms to ensure the decisions are appropriate. These mechanisms include ongoing overviews of\r\nour decision models and random sampling in individual cases. You can always ask for a manual decision-making process instead, express\r\nyour opinion or contest decision making based solely on automated processing, including profiling, if such a decision would produce legal\r\neects or otherwise similarly significantly aect you. You can find out more about how to object to these decisions in Section 10 (\u201cYour\r\ndata protection rights\u201d).\r\nContact our Data Protection Ocer (DPO) Online if you require more information on our use of Automated-decision making or Profiling.\r\n12. Why do we share your Personal Data with credit reference agencies?\r\nIf you have applied for or use our credit Services, in order to process your application, we may supply your Personal Data to credit\r\nreference agencies (CRAs) and they will give us information about you, such as your financial history. We do this to assess creditworthiness\r\nand product suitability, check your identity, trace and recover debts and prevent criminal activity.\r\nThe legal bases for such transmissions are found in Article 6, paragraph 1, letter b (contractual) and Article 6, paragraph 1, letter f\r\n(legitimate interest) of the UK General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cUK GDPR\u201d).\r\nWe will also continue to exchange information about you with CRAs on an ongoing basis, including about your settled accounts and any\r\ndebts not fully repaid on time. This information may be supplied by CRAs to other organizations to perform similar checks and to trace\r\nyour whereabouts and recover debts that you owe.\r\nYour data will also be linked to the data of any joint applicants or other financial associates.\r\nHow to Find Out More\r\nContact our Data Protection Ocer (DPO) Online for details of which CRA we have used for a specific search.\r\nThe list of CRAs used in the UK and EEA, can be found here, including identities of the CRAs used in each relevant country, and a link to\r\ntheir privacy notice from which you can determine the ways in which they use and share Personal Data, including how long they will retain\r\nsuch Personal Data.
