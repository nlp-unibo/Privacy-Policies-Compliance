Customer Content may contain your voice and image, depending on the account owner\u2019s settings, what you choose to share, your settings, and what you do on Zoom products and services. As referenced below, Zoom employees do not access or use Customer Content without the authorization of the hosting account owner, or as required for legal, safety, or security reasons.\r\nUsage Information Regarding Meetings, Webinars, Messaging, Collaborative Features and the Website: Information about how people and their devices interact with Zoom products and services, such as: when participants join and leave a meeting; whether participants sent messages and who they message with; performance data; mouse movements, clicks, keystrokes or actions (such as mute/unmute or video on/off), edits to transcript text, where authorized by the account owner and other inputs that help Zoom to understand feature usage, improve product design, and suggest features; which third-party apps are added to a meeting or other product or service and what information and actions the app is authorized to access and perform; use of third-party apps and the Zoom App Marketplace; features used (such as screen sharing, emojis, or filters); and other usage information and metrics.

Zoom Email is designed to be end-to-end encrypted by Zoom by default for emails sent and received directly between active Zoom Email users. Support for end-to-end encryption requires Zoom Email users to have added a device to their Zoom Email account with the associated email address and to use a supported Zoom client. When an email is end-to-end encrypted, only the users, and, depending on their settings, account owners, or designated account administrators control the encryption key and therefore access to the email content, including body text, subject line, attachments and custom labels applied to messages by users in their inboxes. Emails sent to or received from non-Zoom Email users are encrypted after the email is sent or received from Zoom\u2019s servers, if the Zoom Email user chooses to send them with encryption. In all cases, Zoom does have access to email metadata used for basic email delivery\u2014specifically, email addresses in the from, to, cc, and bcc fields, time, mimeID, and the number and size of attachments. From use of Zoom\u2019s native calendar service, Zoom receives information regarding meeting invitations, body text, sender and recipients, and other calendar information.\r\nContent from Third-Party Integrations: Users can access email and calendars from third-party services through their Zoom client, if they choose to integrate them. This information is not end-to-end encrypted by Zoom, but Zoom employees do not access the contents of third-party-service email or calendar entries, unless authorized to, or required for legal, safety, or security reasons. If account owners and/or their licensed end users integrate their third-party emails with products and services offered or powered by Zoom, such as business analytics tools like Zoom Revenue Accelerator Zoom may collect or process Customer Content and email information, including email content, headers and metadata, from such third-party services.\r\nCommunications with Zoom: Information about, and contents of, your communications with Zoom, including relating to support questions, website virtual chats, your account, and other inquiries.\r\nInformation from Partners: Zoom obtains information about account owners and their users from third-party companies, such as market data enrichment services, including information about an account owner\u2019s company size or industry, contact information, or activity of certain enterprise domains. Zoom may also obtain information from third-party advertising partners that deliver ads displayed on Zoom products and services, such as whether you clicked on an ad they showed you.\r\nIn certain jurisdictions, some of the personal data Zoom receives may be considered sensitive. Please see \u201cCalifornia & Other U.S. State Privacy Rights\u201d for more information.\r\n\r\nHow Do We Use Personal Data?\r\nZoom employees do not access or use Customer Content including meeting, webinar, messaging, or email content (specifically, audio, video, files, in-meeting whiteboards, messaging, or email contents), or any content generated or shared as part of other collaborative features (such as out-of-meeting whiteboards), unless authorized by the account owner hosting the Zoom product or service where the Customer Content was generated, or as required for legal, safety, or security reasons. Zoom does not use any of your audio, video, chat, screen sharing, attachments or other communications-like Customer Content (such as poll results, whiteboard and reactions) to train Zoom\u2019s or third-party artificial intelligence models.\r\n\r\nAs discussed below, and where technically feasible., Zoom uses personal data to conduct the following activities:\r\n\r\nProvide Zoom Products and Services: To provide and develop products and services to account owners, their licensed end users, and those they invite to join meetings and webinars hosted on their accounts, including to customize Zoom products and services and recommendations for accounts or their users. Zoom also uses personal data to determine what products and services may be available in your location, and uses personal data, including contact information, to route invitations, messages, or Zoom Emails to recipients when users send or receive invitations, messages, or Zoom Emails using Zoom products and services. This may also include using personal data for customer support, which may include accessing audio, video, files, messages, and other content or context, at the direction of the account owner or their users. We also use personal data to manage our relationships and contracts with account owners and others, including billing, compliance with contractual obligations, facilitating payment to third-party developers in relation to purchases made through the Zoom App Marketplace, and related administration.\r\nAdvanced Audio and Video Features: If you elect to turn on certain video features, if available in your area, such as filters, studio effects, avatars, and gestures, information about your movements or the positioning of your face or hands may be processed on your device to apply the selected features. Such data does not leave your device, is not retained, cannot be used to identify you, and is only used to generate the selected effects. If certain other features are enabled by the account owner hosting a Zoom product or service, such as transcription generation for recordings, Zoom may use technology that analyzes the meeting\u2019s audio recording to distinguish one speaker from another in order to create an accurate transcript. The audio analysis is not retained after the transcript is generated.\r\nIf you elect to turn on personalized audio isolation, software on your device will capture and analyze a clip of your audio from meetings you join to create an Audio Signature used to differentiate your voice from, and suppress background noise in, meetings you join. Zoom does not receive or retain the clip or Audio Signature, which stays on your device and is only used for noise suppression in meetings you join. You may delete the Audio Signature from your device through your Zoom app settings.\r\n \r\n\r\nIntelligent Features: If enabled by the account owner, Zoom provides intelligent features and products to its customers, their licensed end users and guests, such as Zoom AI Companion or other tools to recommend chat, email or other content. These tools may use artificial intelligence, machine learning, or other technology to process Customer Content solely to provide the intelligent features.\r\nProduct Research and Development: If authorized by any applicable customer settings, to develop, test, and improve Zoom products and services, and to troubleshoot products and services. Zoom does not use any of your audio, video, chat, screen sharing, attachments or other communications-like Customer Content (such as poll results, whiteboard and reactions) to train Zoom\u2019s or third-party artificial intelligence models.\r\nMarketing and Promotions: To permit Zoom and/or its third party marketing partners to market, advertise, and promote Zoom products and services, including based on your product usage, information we receive from third-party partners, information you provide to process referral invitations, or if you visit our websites, information about how and when you visit, and your interactions with them. We may also use this information to provide advertisements to you relating to Zoom products and services or to engage third party partners to analyze your interactions on our website or app or to deliver advertising to you. Zoom does not use Customer Content for any marketing or promotions.\r\nAuthentication, Integrity, Security, and Safety:  To authenticate accounts and activity, detect, investigate, and prevent malicious conduct, fraudulent activity or unsafe experiences, address security threats, protect public safety, and secure Zoom products and services. Zoom uses advanced tools to automatically scan certain types of content such as virtual backgrounds, profile images, incoming emails to Zoom\u2019s native email service from someone who is not a Zoom Email user, and files uploaded or exchanged through chat, for the purpose detecting and preventing violations of our terms or policies and illegal or other harmful activity.\r\nCommunicate with You: We use personal data (including contact information) to communicate with you about Zoom products and services, including product updates, your account, and changes to our policies and terms. We also use your information to respond to you when you contact us.\r\nLegal Reasons: To comply with applicable law or respond to valid legal process, including from law enforcement or government agencies, to investigate or participate in civil discovery, litigation, or other adversarial legal proceedings, protect you, us, and others from fraudulent, malicious, deceptive, abusive, or unlawful activities, and to enforce or investigate potential violations of our Terms of Service or policies.\r\nHow Do We Share Personal Data?\r\nZoom provides personal data to third parties only with consent or in one of the following circumstances (subject to your prior consent where required under applicable law):\r\n\r\nResellers: If an account owner licensed or purchased Zoom products and services from a third-party reseller of Zoom products and services, the reseller may be able to access personal data and content for users, including meetings, webinars, and messages hosted by the account owner.\r\nVendors: Zoom works with third-party service providers to provide, support, and improve Zoom products and services and technical infrastructure, and for business services such as payment processing, including in relation to purchases made through the Zoom App Marketplace. Zoom may also work with third-party service providers to provide advertisements and business analytics regarding Zoom products and services. These vendors can access personal data subject to contractual and technical requirements for protecting personal data and prohibiting them from using personal data for any purpose other than to provide services to Zoom or as required by law. Zoom may integrate third-party technology to provide advanced features, such as Apple\u2019s TrueDepth technology, to process information on your device about your face or hand dimensions and gestures to provide video effects. This information is processed on your device, and such information is neither received nor stored by either the third party, or Zoom.\r\nFor Legal Reasons: Zoom may share personal data as needed to: (1) comply with applicable law or respond to, investigate, or participate in valid legal process and proceedings, including from law enforcement or government agencies; (2) enforce or investigate potential violations of its Terms of Service or policies; (3) detect, prevent, or investigate potential fraud, abuse, or safety and security concerns, including threats to the public; (4) meet our corporate and social responsibility commitments; (5) protect our and our customers\u2019 rights and property; and (6) resolve disputes and enforce agreements.\r\nMarketing, Advertising, and Analytics Partners: Zoom uses third-party marketing, advertising, and analytics providers: to provide statistics and analysis about how people are using Zoom products and services, including our website; and to provide advertising and marketing for Zoom products and services, including targeted advertising based on your use of our website.

Depending on their settings, account owners also can see sender and receiver information, and other messaging data, along with the content of messages sent to and from users on their account (including from in-meeting chat where dedicated meeting group chats are enabled), unless the account owner has enabled Advanced Chat Encryption.

Panelists and attendees may be able to see the name of a participant who asks a question during a Q&A, along with their question, unless the participant submits the question anonymously.\r\nLivestreams: Meeting and webinar hosts can choose to livestream to a third-party site or service, which means anyone with access to the livestream will be able to see the meeting or webinar.\r\nApps and Integrations:  \r\nAccount owners can choose to add Zoom-developed apps and third-party apps to their account and the Zoom products they use, including via use of the Zoom App Marketplace, and they can also control whether their users can add and use specific Zoom and third-party apps, including in meetings, webinars, and chats hosted on their account.\r\nAccount owners can also choose to integrate other content from third-party services\u2013 such as third-party email communications on their corporate account \u2013 to apps and services that they use, such as Zoom Revenue Accelerator (that provides insights and business analytics related to businesses when they use Zoom products). Further, account owners may choose to have Zoom analyze the meeting\u2019s audio recording to distinguish one speaker from another in order to create an accurate transcript.
