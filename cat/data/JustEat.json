For our cookie policy, please refer above (Cookies) for more information.\r\n\r\nWe may allow you to use social media sites to create your account or link your account to the relevant social media site. These social media sites may provide us with automatic access to certain personal data they hold about you (e.g. content viewed by you, content liked by you, and information regarding the advertisements you have been shown or may have clicked on). Where we receive such information, we may use this information to further personalise your experience with us in line with your marketing preferences.\r\n\r\nPersonal Data that we obtain from third-party sources: We may receive personal data from third party sources, including advertising networks and social media platforms such as Facebook or technical payment and delivery services providers which may be located outside EU for purposes such as to support procurement of our Services, to measure the performance of marketing campaigns for our Services; and better understand your preferences so that we can customise our marketing campaigns and Services accordingly.

If you feel that we have collected personal data of a minor without consent, please contact us.

Partners may process your personal data to contact you if it is necessary to fulfil the contract with you.\r\n\r\nYou are a direct customer of the Partner, and therefore the Partner bears its own responsibility and obligations for the processing of your personal data.

We require group companies and third parties to protect your personal data in accordance with the standards set out in this Statement and we take appropriate measures pursuant to the applicable data protection law to guarantee the same level of protection and confidentiality.  \r\n\r\nWe may also share your data with other third parties where appropriate or required by applicable law or regulation (including a court order or legal authority request) or where we believe disclosure is necessary to comply with legal obligations, to exercise, establish or defend legal rights or to protect the vital interests of any person. Such third party controllers may include law enforcement agencies. \r\n\r\nWe may also disclose your personal data to any company or prospective buyer of all or substantially all of our assets in connection with any sale or transfer of those assets.\r\n\r\nYour personal data may be shared with the following parties:\r\n\r\nJET\u2019s affiliates, subsidiaries and/or group companies of JET\r\n\r\nSoftware providers such as providers for software, hosting, application support, delivery, logistics, information security, etc\r\n\r\nThird parties who undertake various activities to promote, market or support our Services.

This may include transferring it to or accessing it from other jurisdictions, including jurisdictions that may not provide a level of protection equivalent to the your local- and/or data protection laws (\u201cNon-Adequate Country\u201d). Where we transfer personal data outside the EEA, Israel, Australia, New Zealand and Canada we will take into account any applicable statutory obligations relevant to personal data transfers, and in Non-Adequate Country, we will rely on appropriate safeguards, including EC approved standard contractual clauses or other lawful binding transfer mechanism pursuant to the applicable data protection law.  \r\n\r\nPersonal data rights, questions or complaints\r\nWe inform you that, with regard to the personal data, you can exercise the rights provided for by applicable data protection laws, which may include: the right to request access to, rectification of, or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing, and to object to processing, the right to data portability, to withdraw your consent at any time (without prejudice to the lawfulness of the processing based on the consent given prior to the withdrawal) as well as to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority directly.\r\n\r\nTo exercise your rights please contact us.\r\n\r\nWe will do our best to address your request in time and free of charge, except where it would require an excessive and disproportionate effort.

This is required because JET and the person that grants you the allowance have a separate responsibility with respect to the processing and protection of your personal data.\r\n\r\nIf you have any other questions or complaints about the processing of your personal data, we will be happy to contact you. We would also like to hear from you if you have tips or suggestions on how to improve our Statement.\r\n\r\nSecurity\r\nJET takes personal data protection very seriously and we therefore take appropriate measures to protect your personal data against misuse, loss, unauthorised access, unwanted disclosure, and unauthorised alteration.
